Therefore it was named `alternative front-ends`. As more projects have been added to the repository, the listed projects partially left the scope of *alternative front-ends*.\n\nFor example, `youtube-dl` is not a front-end, but can be generally described as an open source project that interacts with the internet platform Youtube.\n\nTherefore the name `alternative front-ends` does not capture the full scope of the listed projects anymore. Maybe this repository will be renamed in the future to better reflect the larger scope. A possible name might be `open-source-alternatives` or something similar.\n"
