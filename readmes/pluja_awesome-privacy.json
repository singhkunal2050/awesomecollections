Even using most these alternative frontends, still, the privative services will receive requests about the content you are consuming (even not knowing it is you). This sitll harms the collective privacy and adds data to their algorithms in some ways.

If a government wants to track someone, such apps will be the first ones to fall.\n\n- Closed source VPN apps such as Surfshark or NordVPN may be less trustworthy as nobody can be sure how they handle your data. Also, paying with Credit Card will get you identified on the payment. Furthermore, if you need to give your email it will also identify you if this same email has been used in other services.\n\n\n<img width=\"16\" src=\"misc/check.png\"> </img>  **Instead use**\n\nHere are some open source and truly private (no personal data and/or credit card needed) options:\n\n- [Azire](https://www.azirevpn.com/)\n- [IVPN](https://ivpn.net)\n- [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net)\n- [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com)\n- [SPN](https://safing.io/)\n\n## Web Browser\n\n<img width=\"16\" src=\"misc/forbidden.png\"> </img> **Avoid**\n\n- **Google Chrome** - Owned by google and built upon the open-source Chromium project (also Google-owned). It comes with many privacy-invasive features, it is connected to your Google account most times. It is under [Google's privacy policy](https://tosdr.org/en/service/217) which is known to be very bad. Google is willing to enforce the [Manifest v3](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening) which is outright harmful to privacy efforts.\n- **Microsoft Edge** - It's a Microsoft-themed version of Chromium with Microsoft trackers instead of Google ones. Under [Microsoft's privacy policy](https://tosdr.org/en/service/244), which is also very bad. If you still want to use it, you can [follow this guide](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#edge-19) to harden it a bit.\n- **Opera** - Opera was [acquired by a consortium of Chinese investors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_(web_browser)#Acquisition_by_Chinese_consortium). The app has [many trackers](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/de/reports/com.opera.browser/latest/).\n\n<img width=\"16\" src=\"misc/check.png\"> </img>  **Instead use**\n\n#### Android / iOS\n- [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/) - It has been known to lag on security patches, so it may be better not to use it.\n- [Brave](https://brave.com/) - Android/iOS. Brave offers a pretty good out-of-the-box set of privacy and tracker protections.\n- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/) - Android/iOS\n    - <img width=\"16\" src=\"misc/android.png\"> [Mull](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos/) - Privacy hardened fork of Firefox for Android, with proprietary blobs removed.\n- <img width=\"16\" src=\"misc/android.png\"> [Vanadium](https://vanadium.app/) - Privacy and security enhanced releases of Chromium by GrapheneOS.\n- <img width=\"16\" src=\"misc/android.png\"> [Privacy Browser](https://www.stoutner.com/privacy-browser/)\n- [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) - iOS/Android. Defend yourself against tracking and surveillance and circumvent censorship.\n\n#### Desktop\n- [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium) - A lightweight approach to removing Google web service dependency. Ungoogled-chromium is Google Chromium, sans dependency on Google web services.\n- [Brave](https://brave.com/) - Brave offers a pretty good out-of-the-box set of privacy and tracker protections.\n- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - Open Source, independent browser. It needs some [hardening and tweaking](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#firefox-1) to achieve great privacy.\n  - [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) - Privacy-focused Firefox fork.\n- [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/)\n- [Mullvad Browser](https://mullvad.net/en/browser/) - Browser with the privacy and security implications of the Tor Browser, without the use of the Tor network.\n\n> It may be interesting to learn what you can do to harden your browser. You can follow this [Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to Online Anonymity](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#appendix-v1-hardening-your-browsers) section to do it. Please, if you don't understand what you are doing, don't do it as you may be causing more harm than good to your privacy.\n\n### Browser Addons\n\n#### Anti-tracking\nPlease read about what the addon does before installing. If you don't understand what you are doing you could end up damaging your privacy. Also, too many addons can slow down your browsing experience.\n\n- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) - Free, open-source ad content blocker. Easy on CPU and memory.\n\t- [Read the extension docs](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode) and pick one of the recommended modes to increase your privacy.\n\t- Go to settings > filters list > annoyances, turn on easylist-cookies. This will avoid you the annoying Cookie popups.\n- [LibRedirect](https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect) - A simple web extension that redirects Twitter, YouTube, Google Maps and many more requests to privacy friendly alternatives. Former Privacy Redirect is no longer maintained, LibRedirect is a maintained fork.\n\n#### Useful Tools\n- [Single File](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile) - Save a faithful copy of an entire web page in a single HTML file so you can use it offline.\n\n### Browser Sync\n- [xBrowserSync](https://www.xbrowsersync.org/) - Browser syncing as it should be: secure, anonymous and free!\n\n### WebView\n- <img width=\"16\" src=\"misc/android.png\"> [Bromite WebView](https://www.bromite.org/system_web_view) - Bromite WebView is a version of Android System WebView with support for ad blocking and enhanced privacy.\n  - [WebView Switcher](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/bromitewebview) - A tool for installing Bromite WebView on android 10\n\n\n## Privacy vs Security vs Anonimity\n\nAnonymity, Privacy, and Security are often used interchangeably, but they actually represent distinct concepts. It is important to understand the differences between them.\n\n- Privacy is about regulating who has access to your personal information, being aware of the data that is being collected about you, and having the ability to decide who can access it and how. In short, privacy involves controlling your personal information.\n\n- Security refers to safeguarding your personal information from unauthorized access or theft. It involves ensuring that your data is protected and stored in a secure manner, making it difficult for malicious actors to access it.\n\n- Anonymity is about ensuring that your actions cannot be traced back to you. This means that even if someone discovers what you are doing, they will not be able to identify you as the source.\n\nIt is important to note that privacy and security are not necessarily interdependent. For instance, Google systems are secure and unlikely to be hacked, but Google still has access to your personal data and makes use of it. \n\nPrivacy and anonimity are also not necessarily linked, services like Signal offer high levels of privacy since they do not collect any data about what you say, who you talk to or how you use the app, but they may not be anonymous since you still need to register using your phone number (which is in many cases linked to your identity).\n\nFinally, there are services that may offer all three: anonymity, privacy, and security. The primary focus of this list is to provide alternatives that prioritize privacy. These alternatives give you control over your data and do not collect or sell it.\n\n[Back to top \ud83d\udd1d](#contents)\n"
