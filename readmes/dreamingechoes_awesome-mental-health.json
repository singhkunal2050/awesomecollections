It's the psychological state of someone who is functioning at a satisfactory level of emotional and behavioural adjustment.\n\nIt includes subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, inter-generational dependence, and self-actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others.\n\n> This list compiles several self-help resources we've personally found useful for a range of mental health problems, but in no way are they a replacement of professional help, psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy. **We're not experts**, and even if we were, most of these tools are meant as an aid to therapy, not as a substitute.\n>\n>**If you're in a crisis, please see [here](https://twloha.com/find-help/international-resources/), or [here](https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/) for resources in your country.**\n\n## Contents\n\n- [Applications](#applications)\n- [Articles](#articles)\n- [Books](#books)\n- [Conferences](#conferences)\n- [Meetups](#meetups)\n- [Organizations](#organizations)\n- [Podcasts](#podcasts)\n- [Talks](#talks)\n\n## Applications\n\nApplications to help with dealing with anxiety, depression or other mental health problems.\n\n* [Moodpath](https://mymoodpath.com/en/) - Interactive, app-based screening, created to recognize symptoms of depression.\n* [Nyxo](https://nyxo.app) \u2013\u00a0Open source sleep tracking and sleep coaching app for iOS and Android.\n* [Sanvello](https://sanvello.com) - Daily tools for stress, anxiety, and depression alongside a supportive community.
