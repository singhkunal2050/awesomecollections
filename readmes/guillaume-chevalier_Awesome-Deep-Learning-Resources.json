It has been useful to me for learning how to do deep learning, I use it for revisiting topics or for reference.\nI ([Guillaume Chevalier](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier)) have built this list and got through all of the content listed here, carefully.\n\n\n## Contents\n\n- [Trends](#trends)\n- [Online classes](#online-classes)\n- [Books](#books)\n- [Posts and Articles](#posts-and-articles)\n- [Practical resources](#practical-resources)\n  - [Librairies and Implementations](#librairies-and-implementations)\n  - [Some Datasets](#some-datasets)\n- [Other Math Theory](#other-math-theory)\n  - [Gradient Descent Algorithms and optimization](#gradient-descent-algorithms-and-optimization)\n  - [Complex Numbers & Digital Signal Processing](#complex-numbers-and-digital-signal-processing)\n- [Papers](#papers)\n  - [Recurrent Neural Networks](#recurrent-neural-networks)\n  - [Convolutional Neural Networks](#convolutional-neural-networks)\n  - [Attention Mechanisms](#attention-mechanisms)\n  - [Other](#other)\n- [YouTube and Videos](#youtube)\n- [Misc.

Some hard automation tasks can be solved easily with that while this was impossible to achieve earlier with classical algorithms.\n\nMoore's Law about exponential progress rates in computer science hardware is now more affecting GPUs than CPUs because of physical limits on how tiny an atomic transistor can be. We are shifting toward parallel architectures\n[[read more](https://www.quora.com/Does-Moores-law-apply-to-GPUs-Or-only-CPUs)]. Deep learning exploits parallel architectures as such under the hood by using GPUs. On top of that, deep learning algorithms may use Quantum Computing and apply to machine-brain interfaces in the future.\n\nI find that the key of intelligence and cognition is a very interesting subject to explore and is not yet well understood. Those technologies are promising.\n\n\n<a name=\"online-classes\" />\n\n## Online Classes\n\n- **[DL&RNN Course](https://www.dl-rnn-course.neuraxio.com/start?utm_source=github_awesome) - I created this richely dense course on Deep Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks.**\n- [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) - Renown entry-level online class with [certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/DXPXHYFNGKG3).

Sequences recall problem.\n- [Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) - LSTMs' attention mechanisms on CNNs feature maps does wonders.\n- [Teaching Machines to Read and Comprehend](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03340v3.pdf) - A very interesting and creative work about textual question answering, what a breakthrough, there is something to do with that.\n- [Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.04025.pdf) - Exploring different approaches to attention mechanisms.\n- [Matching Networks for One Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04080.pdf) - Interesting way of doing one-shot learning with low-data by using an attention mechanism and a query to compare an image to other images for classification.\n- [Google\u2019s Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08144.pdf) - In 2016: stacked residual LSTMs with attention mechanisms on encoder/decoder are the best for NMT (Neural Machine Translation).\n- [Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory](http://www.nature.com/articles/nature20101.epdf?author_access_token=ImTXBI8aWbYxYQ51Plys8NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MggmpDmwljGswxVdeocYSurJ3hxupzWuRNeGvvXnoO8o4jTJcnAyhGuZzXJ1GEaD-Z7E6X_a9R-xqJ9TfJWBqz) - Improvements on differentiable memory based on NTMs: now it is the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC).\n- [Massive Exploration of Neural Machine Translation Architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03906.pdf) - That yields intuition about the boundaries of what works for doing NMT within a framed seq2seq problem formulation.\n- [Natural TTS Synthesis by Conditioning WaveNet on Mel Spectrogram\nPredictions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05884.pdf) - A [WaveNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499v2.pdf) used as a vocoder can be conditioned on generated Mel Spectrograms from the Tacotron 2 LSTM neural network with attention to generate neat audio from text.\n- [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (AIAYN) - Introducing multi-head self-attention neural networks with positional encoding to do sentence-level NLP without any RNN nor CNN - this paper is a must-read (also see [this explanation](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html) and [this visualization](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) of the paper). \n\n<a name=\"other\" />\n\n### Other\n\n- [ProjectionNet: Learning Efficient On-Device Deep Networks Using Neural Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00630) - Replace word embeddings by word projections in your deep neural networks, which doesn't require a pre-extracted dictionnary nor storing embedding matrices. \n- [Self-Governing Neural Networks for On-Device Short Text Classification](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1105) - This paper is the sequel to the ProjectionNet just above. The SGNN is elaborated on the ProjectionNet, and the optimizations are detailed more in-depth (also see my [attempt to reproduce the paper in code](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/SGNN-Self-Governing-Neural-Networks-Projection-Layer) and watch [the talks' recording](https://vimeo.com/305197775)).\n- [Matching Networks for One Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04080) - Classify a new example from a list of other examples (without definitive categories) and with low-data per classification task, but lots of data for lots of similar classification tasks - it seems better than siamese networks. To sum up: with Matching Networks, you can optimize directly for a cosine similarity between examples (like a self-attention product would match) which is passed to the softmax directly. I guess that Matching Networks could probably be used as with negative-sampling softmax training in word2vec's CBOW or Skip-gram without having to do any context embedding lookups. \n\n\n<a name=\"youtube\" />\n\n## YouTube and Videos\n\n- [Attention Mechanisms in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - IGGG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuvRWevJMZ4) - A talk for a reading group on attention mechanisms (Paper: Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate).\n- [Tensor Calculus and the Calculus of Moving Surfaces](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlXfTHzgMRULkodlIEqfgTS-H1AY_bNtq) - Generalize properly how Tensors work, yet just watching a few videos already helps a lot to grasp the concepts.\n- [Deep Learning & Machine Learning (Advanced topics)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlp-GWNOd6m4C_-9HxuHg2_ZeI2Yzwwqt) - A list of videos about deep learning that I found interesting or useful, this is a mix of a bit of everything.\n- [Signal Processing Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlp-GWNOd6m6gSz0wIcpvl4ixSlS-HEmr) - A YouTube playlist I composed about DFT/FFT, STFT and the Laplace transform - I was mad about my software engineering bachelor not including signal processing classes (except a bit in the quantum physics class).\n- [Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlp-GWNOd6m7vLOsW20xAJ81-65C-Ys6k) - Yet another YouTube playlist I composed, this time about various CS topics.\n- [Siraj's Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) - Siraj has entertaining, fast-paced video tutorials about deep learning.\n- [Two Minute Papers' Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz/videos?sort=p&view=0&flow=grid) - Interesting and shallow overview of some research papers, for example about WaveNet or Neural Style Transfer.\n- [Geoffrey Hinton interview](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/dcm5r/geoffrey-hinton-interview) - Andrew Ng interviews Geoffrey Hinton, who talks about his research and breaktroughs, and gives advice for students.\n- [Growing Neat Software Architecture from Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4QN27IKr0g) - A primer on how to structure your Machine Learning projects when using Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n<a name=\"misc-hubs-and-links\" />\n\n## Misc.
