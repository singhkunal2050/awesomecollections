I use that term as widely as possible. This list is not meant to replace these lists. Earth Observation is still <b>way</b> behind the GIS world in terms of audience, reach, number of users etc. Things are changing though, by bringing these links together I hope you can see that there has been so much progress in the last 5 years. I do hope these links are helpful espcially to those who are new to Earth Observation, but also to people like me who with several years of experience think they may have seen it all - we haven't and there is still so much to learn. Earth Observation is not just an academic 'thing' or a basemap anymore, it forms the basis for a growing and diverse business environment. Lets embrace this.\n\nFinally, I wanted to acknowledge a couple of awesome Earth Observation lists that you may list to check out:\n\n- [Awesome Sentinel](https://github.com/Fernerkundung/awesome-sentinel) - curated list of awesome tools, tutorials and APIs for Copernicus Sentinel satellite data\n- [awesome-remote-sensing](https://github.com/attibalazs/awesome-remote-sensing) - Collection of Remote Sensing Resources\n- [awesome-Geospatial](https://github.com/sacridini/Awesome-Geospatial) - Long list of geospatial tools and resources\n- [awesome-remote-sensing-change-detection](https://github.com/wenhwu/awesome-remote-sensing-change-detection) - List of datasets, codes, and contests related to remote sensing change detection.\n- [Awesome Geospatial Companies](https://github.com/chrieke/awesome-geospatial-companies) - List of 500+ geospatial companies (GIS, Earth Observation, UAV, Satellite, Digital Farming, ..)\n\n#### End\n\n[![CC BY 1.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]\n\nThis work is licensed under a\n[Creative Commons Attribution 1.0 International License][cc-by].\n\n[![CC BY 1.0][cc-by-image]][cc-by]\n\n[cc-by]: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/\n[cc-by-image]: https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/1.0/88x31.png\n[cc-by-shield]: https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY%201.0-lightgrey\n"
