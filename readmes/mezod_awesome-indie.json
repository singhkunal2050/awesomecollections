Here, I try to curate a list of resources to help everyone interested in making money from their digital products get inspired and give it a try. Be it monetizing side-projects, bootstrapping business ideas, etc.\n\nProjects don't need to be big, actually, it's better if they are not, they just need to be profitable. They might provide a passive income after the initial bulk of work, and who knows, maybe even help you reach financial independence.\n\nGoing indie does have lots of lifestyle perks :)\n\nAll these resources might help inspire you and put you on the right track but in the end what matters is to **MAKE and TRY stuff**. So devour this content responsibly :)\n\nContributions are more than welcome.\n\nby **[@mezod](https://twitter.com/mezood)** (Doing things every day with **[everyday.app](https://everyday.app)**)\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- If [$], it means it's not free and probably means I haven't tried it but still decided to add it because of the several references.\n- This repo was once [#1 on Github Trending](https://medium.com/@mezood/making-money-from-your-own-code-has-never-been-easier-but-its-still-hard-2242ddaae6a1)! :_)\n- [Icepy](https://github.com/icepy) translated this repo to [Chinese](https://github.com/icepy/awesome-indie) :)\n\n<!-- In general, I'd be wary of the several paid content-like products specially targeted to indie devs, so unless you can prove their value I'd like to keep them off of this list as much as possible. -->\n\n## Contents\n\n- [Communities](#communities)\n- [Newsletters](#newsletters)\n- [Podcasts](#podcasts)\n- [Talks](#talks)\n- [Posts](#posts)\n- [Blogs](#blogs)\n- [Case Studies](#case-studies)\n- [Events](#events)\n- [Books](#books)\n- [Tools](#tools)\n- [Courses](#courses)\n- [Specific Topics](#specific-topics)\n\n### Communities\n- **[IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses)**\n\n  Learn from profitable businesses and side projects. IndieHackers is probably the catalyst for this new wave of interest on making an independent income. It is a collection of interviews to successful developers about their products. IndieHackers has been especially interesting to follow since it's been an indie project itself. [Courtland Allen](https://twitter.com/csallen?lang=ca) has been very transparent about [how he built it](https://www.indiehackers.com/blog).
