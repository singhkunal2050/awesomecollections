Ralph Johnson famously defined\nsoftware architecture as \"the important stuff (whatever that is).\" I, subjectively, followed his definition while\ndeciding whether or not to include a specific book.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [What is this? (important)](#what-is-this)\n- [How did I make this?](#how-did-i-make-this)\n- [What should I read?](#what-should-i-read)\n- [Inclusion criteria](#inclusion-criteria)\n- [Sorting criteria](#sorting-criteria)\n- [Books](#books)\n    - [System Architecture](#system-architecture)\n    - [Design Patterns](#design-patterns)\n    - [Domain-Driven Design](#domain-driven-design)\n    - [Microservices](#microservices)\n    - [Data Engineering](#data-engineering)\n    - [Streaming and Messaging](#streaming-and-messaging)\n    - [Distributed Systems](#distributed-systems)\n    - [Cloud Engineering](#cloud-engineering)\n    - [Web Scalability](#web-scalability)\n    - [Agile](#agile)\n    - [DevOps](#devops)\n    - [General](#general)\n- [Find me at Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63237197)\n\n## What is this?\n\nThis is NOT a recommendation list. When I made this, I intended for a comprehensive list excluding low-profile books\u2014see\ninclusion criteria below. There was a simple reason behind that: I'm not a subject-matter expert on all these topics. In\nfact, I not a subject-matter expert on even a single topic of these. More importantly, I don't know your experience\nlevel nor your preferences. Some people prefer theoretical over practical books (I do). Others prefer foundational over\ncomprehensive books or dry over engaging books or art-based over engineering-based books. Some people even enjoy verbose\nover concise books. Or and or and or.\n\n## How did I make this?\n\nI thoroughly reviewed all books\n[tagged with software-architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/software-architecture) on Goodreads and applied\na simple algorithmic rules\u2014see the inclusion criteria below. I don't think the list is perfectly comprehensive. Yet, I'm\nplanning to update it regularly to make it as comprehensive as possible.\n\n## What should I read?\n\nDon't be overwhelmed by the number of books on each subject. Practically speaking, you are supposed to read a few books\non the subjects of your interest. Deciding what to read is your business. Personally, I start by reading a couple of\nreviews on Goodreads and examine the book table of content, if available. When in doubt, I read more reviews over the\ninternet from blogs and the like. Alternatively, you may go with the Goodreads community preferences and start from the\ntop of each list if you don't have the time to read reviews.\n\n## Inclusion criteria\n\n- The book must be relevant to Software Architecture; and\n- The content is not obsolete.\n- It must be technology agnostic or applicable to a wide range of technologies; and\n- The book profile on Goodreads matches these rules:\n    - An average rating of 3.5 or above; and\n    - A total number of ratings equals 50 or above.\n    - At least 5 written reviews.\n    - A minimum length of 50 pages.\n\n## Sorting criteria\n\nThe books are sorted solely based on the number of **written** reviews. There are, however, other important factors\nworth considering. For example, the average rating, the number of ratings, and the publishing date. Yet, I don't have an\nidea to put all these factors in a reasonable mathematical formula. If you have\nany, [I'd love to hear](https://github.com/mhadidg/software-architecture-books/issues/new) what you've got in mind.\n\n## Books\n\n### System Architecture\n\n| Title
