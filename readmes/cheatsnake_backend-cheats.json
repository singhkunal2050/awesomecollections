All material is divided into chapters that include different topics. There are three main parts to each topic:\n\n-   **Visual part** - various images/tables/cheatsheets for better understanding (may not be available). All pictures and tables are made from scratch, specifically for this repository.\n-   **Summary** - A very brief summary with a list of key terms and concepts. The terms are hyperlinked to the appropriate section on Wikipedia or a similar reference resource.\n-   **References to sources** - resources where you may find complete information on a particular issue (they are hidden under a spoiler, which opens when clicked). If possible, the most authoritative sources are indicated, or those that provide information in as simple and comprehensible language as possible.\n\n> \ud83c\udf10 Available translations:

from around the world into a single network for storing/transferring information. The Internet was originally developed for the military. But soon it began to be implemented in universities, and then it could be used by private companies, which began to organize networks of providers that provide Internet access services to ordinary citizens. By early 2020, the number of Internet users exceeded 4.5 billion.\n\n-   ### How the Internet works\n\n    <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"./files/network-internet/Internet.png\" alt=\"Internet\"/></p>\n\n    Your computer does not have direct access to the Internet. Instead, it has access to your local network to which other devices are connected via a wired ([Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet)) or wireless (Wi-Fi) connection. The organizer of such a network is a special minicomputer - [router](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)>). This device connects you to your [Internet Service Provider (ISP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider), which in turn is connected to other higher-level ISPs. Thus, all these interactions make up the Internet, and your messages always transit through different networks before reaching the final recipient.\n\n    -   [Host](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network)>)\n        > Any device that is on any network.\n    -   [Server](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)>)\n        > A special computer on the network that serves requests from other computers.\n\n    <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"./files/network-internet/topologies.png\" alt=\"Network topologies\"/></p>\n\n    -   [Network topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology)\n        > There are several topologies (ways of organizing a network): [Point to point](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-point_(telecommunications)>), [Daisy chain](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_chain_(electrical_engineering)>), [Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_network), [Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_network), [Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_network) and [Mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking). The Internet itself cannot be referred to any one topology, because it is an incredibly complex system mixed with different topologies.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcc4 [**How does the Internet work?** \u2013 MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)\n2. \ud83d\udcfa [**How does the internet work?

They consist of parts (levels) separated from each other by a dot. Each of these parts provides specific information about the domain name. For example country, service name, localization, etc.\n\n    -   Who owns domain names\n        > [The ICANN Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN) is the founder of the distributed domain registration system. It gives accreditations to companies that want to sell domains. In this way a competitive domain market is formed.\n    -   How to buy a domain name\n        > A domain name cannot be bought forever. It is leased for a certain period of time. It is better to buy domains from [accredited registrars](https://www.icann.org/en/accredited-registrars?filter-letter=a&sort-direction=asc&sort-param=name&page=1) (you can find them in almost any country).\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcc4 [**What is a Domain Name?** \u2013 MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_domain_name)\n2. \ud83d\udcfa [**A Beginners Guide to How Domain Names Work!** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/Y4cRx19nhJk)\n </details>\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n-   ### IP address\n\n    <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"./files/network-internet/IPv4-IPv6.png\" alt=\"IPv4-IPv6\"/></p>\n\n    [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) is a unique numeric address that is used to recognize a particular device on the network.\n\n    -   Levels of visibility\n        > -   External and publicly accessible IP address that belongs to your ISP and is used to access the Internet by hundreds of other users.\n        > -   The IP address of your router in your ISP's local network, the same IP address from which you access the Internet.\n        > -   The IP address of your computer in the local (home) network created by the router, to which you can connect your devices. Typically, it looks like 192.168.XXX.XXX.\n        > -   The internal IP address of the computer, inaccessible from the outside and used only for communication between the running processes. It is the same for everyone - 127.0.0.1 or just _localhost_.\n    -   [Port](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)>)\n        > One device (computer) can run many applications that use the network. In order to correctly recognize where and which data coming over the network should be delivered (to which of the applications) a special numerical number - a port is used. That is, each running process on a computer which uses a network connection has its own personal port.\n    -   [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4)\n        > Version 4 of the IP protocol. It was developed in 1981 and limits the address space to about 4.3 billion (2^32) possible unique addresses.\n    -   [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6)\n        > Over time, the allocation of address space began to happen at a much faster rate, forcing the creation of a new version of the IP protocol to store more addresses. IPv6 is capable of issuing 2^128 (is huge number) unique addresses.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcfa [**IP addresses.

Using Linux on servers is profitable because it is free and open source, secure and works fast on cheap hardware.\n\nThere are a huge number of [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) (preinstalled software bundles) to suit all tastes. One of the most popular is [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu). This is where you can start your dive into server development.\n\n[Install Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) on a separate PC or laptop. If this is not possible, you can use a special program [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) where you can [run other OS](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#create-vm-wizard) on top of the main OS. You can also run [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) [Ubuntu image container](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) (Docker is a [separate topic](#docker) that is exists in this repository).\n\n-   ### Working with shell\n\n    [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) (or console, terminal) is a computer program which is used to operate and control a computer by entering special text commands. Generally, servers do not have [graphical interfaces (GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), so you will definitely need to learn how to work with shells. The are many [Unix shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell), but most Linux distributions come with a [Bash shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) by default.\n\n    -   Basic commands for navigating the file system\n        ```sh\n        ls # list directory contents\n        cd [PATH] # go to specified directory\n        cd .. # move to a higher level (to the parent directory)\n        touch [FILE] # create a file\n        cat > [FILE] # enter text into the file (overwrite)\n        cat >> [FILE] # enter text at the end of the file (append)\n        cat/more/less [FILE] # to view the file contents\n        head/tail [FILE] # view the first/last lines of a file\n        pwd # print path to current directory\n        mkdir [NAME] # create a directory\n        rmdir [NAME] # delete a directory\n        cp [FILE] [PATH] # copy a file or directory\n        mv [FILE] [PATH] # moving or renaming\n        rm [FILE] # deleting a file or directory\n        find [STRING] # file system search\n        du [FILE] # output file or directory size\n        grep [PATTERN] [FILE] # print lines that match patterns\n        ```\n    -   Commands for help information\n        ```sh\n        man [COMMAND] # allows you to view a manual for any command\n        apropos [STRING] # search for a command with a description that has a specified word\n        man -k [STRING] # similar to the command above\n        whatis [COMMAND] # a brief description of the command\n        ```\n    -   [Super user rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo)\n        > Analogue to running as administrator in Windows\n        ```sh\n        sudo [COMMAND] # executes a command with superuser privileges\n        ```\n    -   Text editor\n        > Study any in order to read and edit files freely through the terminal.\n        > The easiest \u2013 [nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano).\n        > Something in the middle - [micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/).\n        > The most advanced \u2013 [Vim](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)>).\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcc4 [**31 Linux Commands Every Ubuntu User Should Know**](https://itsfoss.com/essential-ubuntu-commands/)\n2. \ud83d\udcc4 [**The Linux Command Handbook** \u2013 freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-linux-commands-handbook/)\n3. \ud83d\udcc4 [**A to Z: List of Linux commands**](https://linuxhandbook.com/a-to-z-linux-commands/)\n4. \ud83d\udcfa [**The 50 Most Popular Linux & Terminal Commands** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/ZtqBQ68cfJc)\n5. \ud83d\udcfa [**Nano Editor Fundamentals** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/gyKiDczLIZ4)\n6. \ud83d\udcfa [**Vim Tutorial for Beginners** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/RZ4p-saaQkc)\n7. \ud83d\udcc4 [**Awesome Terminals** \u2013 GitHub](https://github.com/cdleon/awesome-terminals)\n8. \ud83d\udcc4 [**Awesome CLI-apps** \u2013 GitHub](https://github.com/agarrharr/awesome-cli-apps)\n </details>\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n-   ### Package manager\n\n    The package manager is a utility that allows you to install/update software packages from the terminal.\n\n    Linux distributions can be divided into several groups, depending on which package manager they use: [apt](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)>) (in [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian) based distributions), [RPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager) (the [Red Hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux) package management system) and [Pacman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux#Pacman) (the package manager in [Arch-like distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux))\n\n    Ubuntu is based on Debian, so it uses apt (advanced packaging tool) package manager.\n\n    -   Basic commands\n        ```sh\n        apt install [package] # install the package\n        apt remove [package] # remove the package, but keep the configuration\n        apt purge [package] # remove the package along with the configuration\n        apt update # update information about new versions of packages\n        apt upgrade # update the packages installed in the system\n        apt list --installed # list of packages installed on the system\n        apt list --upgradable # list of packages that need to be updated\n        apt search [package] # searching for packages by name on the network\n        apt show [package] # package information\n        ```\n    -   [aptitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptitude_(software))\n        > Interactive console utility for easy viewing of packages to install, update and uninstall them.\n    -   Repository management\n        > Package managers typically work with software repositories.

This means that several people can run many different applications at the same time on the same computer. For the Linux system to be able to \"recognize\" a user, he must be logged in and therefore each user must have a unique name and a secret password.\n\n    -   Working with users\n        ```sh\n        useradd [name] [flags] # create a new user\n        passwd [name] # set a password for the user\n        usermod [name] [flags] # edit a user\n        usermod -L [name] # block a user\n        usermod -U [name] # unblock a user\n        userdel [name] [flags] # delete a user\n        su [name] # switch to other user\n        ```\n    -   Working with groups\n        ```sh\n        groupadd [group] [flags] # create a group\n        groupmod [group] [flags] # edit group\n        groupdel [group] [flags] # delete group\n        usermod -a -G [groups] [user] # add a user to groups\n        gpasswd --delete [user] [groups] # remove a user from groups\n        ```\n    -   System files\n        ```sh\n        /etc/passwd # a file containing basic information about users\n        /etc/shadow # a file containing encrypted passwords\n        /etc/group # a file containing basic information about groups\n        /etc/gshadow # a file containing encrypted group passwords\n        ```\n\n    In Linux, it is possible to share privileges between users, limit access to unwanted files or features, control available actions for services, and much more.

It is already clear how to convert numbers from different number systems to binary. But you can't do that with text. That's why special tables called [encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) were invented, in which text characters are assigned numeric equivalents.\n\n    -   [ASCII (American standard code for information interchange)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)\n        > The simplest encoding created specifically for the American alphabet.

There is plenty of information on various languages in the Internet (books, courses, thematic sites, etc.), so you should have no problem finding information.\n\n> Below is a list of specific languages that [personally, in my opinion](https://github.com/cheatsnake) are good for backend development (\u26a0\ufe0f may not agree with the opinions of others, including those more competent in this matter).\n\n-   [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>)\n    > A very popular language with a wide range of applications. Easy to learn due to its simple syntax.\n-   [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)\n    > No less popular and practically the only language for full-fledged Web-development. Thanks to the platform [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) last few years is gaining popularity in the field of backend development as well.\n-   [Go](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)>)\n    > A language created internally by Google. It was created specifically for high-load server development. Minimalistic syntax, high performance and rich standard library.\n-   [Kotlin](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)>)\n    > A kind of modern version of [Java](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>). Simpler and more concise syntax, better type-safety, built-in tools for multithreading. One of the best choices for Android development.\n\nFind a good book or online tutorial in English at [this repository](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/main/books/free-programming-books-langs.md). There is a large collection for different languages and frameworks.\n\nLook for a special [awesome repository](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#programming-languages) - a resource that contains a huge number of useful links to materials for your language (libraries, cheat sheets, blogs and other various resources).\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n-   ### Classification of programming languages\n\n    There are many programming languages. They are all created for a reason. Some languages may be very specific and used only for certain purposes. Also, different languages may use different approaches to writing programs. They may even run differently on a computer. In general, there are many different [classifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_language_classification), which would be useful to understand.\n\n    -   Depending on language level\n        -   [Low level languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language)\n            > As close to [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code), complex to write, but as productive as possible. As a rule, it provides access to all of the computer's resources.\n        -   [High-level languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language)\n            > They have a fairly high level of abstraction, which makes them easy to write and easy to use. As a rule, they are safer because they do not provide access to all of the computer's resources.\n    -   Depending on [implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_implementation)\n        -   [Compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler)\n            > Allows you to convert the source code of a program to an executable file.\n        -   [Interpretation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)>)\n            > The source code of a program is translated and immediately executed (interpreted) by a special interpreter program.\n        -   [Virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)\n            > In this approach, the program is not compiled into a machine code, but into machine-independent low-level code - [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode). This bytecode is then executed by the virtual machine itself.\n    -   [Depending on the programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm)\n        -   [Imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming)\n            > Focuses on describing the steps to solve a problem through a sequence of statements or commands.\n        -   [Declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)\n            > Focuses on describing what the program should do, rather than how it should do it. Examples of declarative languages include SQL and HTML.\n        -   [Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)\n            > Based on the idea of treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It emphasizes [immutability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object), avoiding [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)), and using [higher-order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function). Examples of functional languages include Haskell, Lisp, and Clojure.\n        -   [Object-Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)\n            > Revolves around creating objects that contain both data and behavior, with the goal of modeling real-world concepts. Examples of object-oriented languages include Java, Python, and C++.\n        -   [Concurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing)\n            > Focused on handling multiple tasks or threads at the same time, and is used in systems that require high performance and responsiveness.

This approach combines several very important principles which allow to write modular, extensible and loosely coupled code.\n\n    -   Understanding [Classes](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)>)\n        > A class can be understood as a custom data type (a kind of template) in which you describe the structure of future objects that will implement the class. Classes can contain `properties` (these are specific fields in which data of a particular data type can be stored) and `methods` (these are functions that have access to properties and the ability to manipulate, modify them).\n    -   Understanding [objects](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)>)\n        > An object is a specific implementation of a class. If, for example, the _name_ property with type _string_ is described in a class, the object will have a specific value for that field, for example _\"Alex\"_.\n    -   [Inheritance principle](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)>)\n        > Ability to create new classes that inherit properties and methods of their parents. This allows you to reuse code and create a hierarchy of classes.\n    -   [Encapsulation principle](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)>)\n        > Ability to hide certain properties/methods from external access, leaving only a simplified interface for interacting with the object.\n    -   [Polymorphism principle](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)>)\n        > The ability to implement the same method differently in descendant classes.\n    -   [Composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) over inheritance\n        > Often the principle of `inheritance` can complicate and confuse your program if you do not think carefully about how to build the future hierarchy. That is why there is an alternative (more flexible) approach called composition. In particular, Go language lacks classes and many OOP principles, but widely [uses composition](https://golangbyexample.com/oop-inheritance-golang-complete).\n    -   [Dependency injection (DI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)\n        > Dependency injection is a popular OOP pattern that allows objects to receive their dependencies (other objects) from the outside rather than creating them internally. It promotes loose coupling between classes, making code more modular, maintainable, and easier to test.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcfa [**Intro to Object Oriented Programming - Crash Course** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/SiBw7os-_zI)\n2. \ud83d\udcc4 [**OOP Meaning \u2013 What is Object-Oriented Programming?** \u2013 freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-object-oriented-programming/)\n3. \ud83d\udcfa [**OOP in Python (CS50 lecture)** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/SiBw7os-_zI)\n4. \ud83d\udcc4 [**OOP tutorial from Python docs**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)\n5. \ud83d\udcfa [**OOP in JavaScript: Made Super Simple** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/PFmuCDHHpwk)\n6. \ud83d\udcc4 [**OOP in Go by examples**](https://golangbyexample.com/golang-comprehensive-tutorial/#OOPS_in_Golang)\n7. \ud83d\udcfa [**Object Oriented Programming is not what I thought - Talk by Anjana Vakil** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/TbP2B1ijWr8)\n8. \ud83d\udcfa [**The Flaws of Inheritance (tradeoffs between Inheritance and Composition)** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/hxGOiiR9ZKg)\n9. \ud83d\udcfa [**Dependency Injection, The Best Pattern** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/J1f5b4vcxCQ?si=9kgJNwZgMFd7r7fX)\n </details>\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n-   ### Server development\n\n    -   Understand sockets\n        > A socket is an endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running over a network.

Such operations may include reading files, requesting to a database or remote server, reading user input, and so on. In these cases, the program spends a lot of time waiting for external resources to respond, and asynchronous programming allows the program to perform other tasks while waiting for the response.\n\n    -   [Callback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming))\n        > This is function that is passed as an argument to another function and is intended to be called by that function at a later time. The purpose of a callback is to allow the calling function to continue executing while the called function performs a time-consuming or asynchronous task. Once the task is complete, the called function will invoke the callback function, passing it any necessary data as arguments.\n    -   [Event-driven architecture (EDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture)\n        > A popular approach to writing asynchronous programs. The logic of the program is to wait for certain events and process them as they arrive. This can be useful in web applications that need to handle a large number of concurrent connections, such as chat applications or real-time games.\n    -   Asynchronous in particular languages\n        > - In Python, asynchronous programming can be done using the [asyncio module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), which provides an event loop and coroutine-based API for concurrency. There are also other third-party libraries like [Twisted](https://github.com/twisted/twisted) and [Tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado) that provide asynchronous capabilities.\n        > - In JavaScript, asynchronous programming is commonly achieved through the use of [promises](https://javascript.info/promise-basics), [callbacks](https://javascript.info/callbacks), [async/await syntax](https://javascript.info/async-await) and the [event loop](https://javascript.info/event-loop).\n        > - Go has built-in support for concurrency through [goroutines and channels](https://go.dev/tour/concurrency/1), which allow developers to write asynchronous code that can communicate and synchronize across multiple threads.\n        > - Kotlin provides [coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) are similar to JavaScript's async/await and Python's asyncio, and can be used with a variety of platforms and frameworks.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcfa [**Synchronous vs Asynchronous Applications (Explained by Example)** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/N5Ky-mz6n-8)\n2. \ud83d\udcc4 [**Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough**](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/)\n3. \ud83d\udcc4 [**Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript \u2013 Guide for Beginners** \u2013 freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/asynchronous-programming-in-javascript/)\n4. \ud83d\udcc4 [**A roadmap for asynchronous programming in JavaScript**](https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/ch_async-js.html#roadmap-async-functions)\n5. \ud83d\udcfa [**Master Go Programming With These Concurrency Patterns** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/qyM8Pi1KiiM)\n6. \ud83d\udcfa [**Kotlin coroutines: new ways to do asynchronous programming** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/WlGEOu-Ka-E)\n </details>\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n-   ### Multitasking\n\n    Computers today have processors with several physical and virtual cores, and if we take into account server machines, their number can reach up to hundreds. All of these available resources would be good to use to the fullest, for maximum application performance. That is why modern server development cannot do without implementing [multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking) and [paralleling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing).\n\n    -   How it works\n        > Multitasking refers to the concurrent execution of multiple [threads](#processes-and-threads) of control within a single program. A thread is a lightweight process that runs within the context of a [process](#processes-and-threads), and has its own stack, program counter, and register set. Multiple threads can share the resources of a single process, such as memory, files, and I/O devices. Each thread executes independently and can perform a different task or part of a task.\n    -   Multitasking types\n        > - [Cooperative multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking): each program or task voluntarily gives up control of the CPU to allow other programs or tasks to run. Each program or task is responsible for yielding control to other programs or tasks at appropriate times. This approach requires programs or tasks to be well-behaved and to avoid monopolizing the CPU. If a program or task does not yield control voluntarily, it can cause the entire system to become unresponsive. Cooperative multitasking was commonly used in early operating systems and is still used in some embedded systems or real-time operating systems.\n        > - [Preemptive multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)): operating system forcibly interrupts programs or tasks at regular intervals to allow other programs or tasks to run. The operating system is responsible for managing the CPU and ensuring that each program or task gets a fair share of CPU time. This approach is more robust than cooperative multitasking and can handle poorly behaved programs or tasks that do not yield control. Preemptive multitasking is used in modern operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.\n    -   Main problems and difficulties\n        > - [Race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition): When multiple threads access and modify shared data concurrently, race conditions can occur, resulting in unpredictable behavior or incorrect results.\n        > - [Deadlocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock): Occur when two or more threads are blocked waiting for resources that are held by other threads, resulting in a deadlock.\n        > - Debugging: Multitasking programs can be difficult to debug due to their complexity and non-deterministic behavior. You need to use advanced debugging tools and techniques, such as thread dumps, profilers, and logging, to diagnose and fix issues.\n    -   Synchronizing primitives\n        > Needed to securely exchange data between different threads.\n        > - [Semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)): It is essentially a counter that keeps track of the number of available resources and can block threads or processes that try to acquire more than the available resources.\n        > - [Mutex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion): (short for mutual exclusion) allows only one thread or process to access the resource at a time, ensuring that there are no conflicts or race conditions.\n        > - [Atomic operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearizability): operations that are executed as a single, indivisible unit, without the possibility of interruption or interference by other threads or processes.\n        > - [Condition variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization)): allows threads to wait for a specific condition to be true before continuing execution. It is often used in conjunction with a mutex to avoid busy waiting and improve efficiency.\n    -   Working with particular language\n        > - In Python you can see [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) and [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) modules.\n        > - In Node.js you can work with [worker threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#worker-threads), [cluster module](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html#cluster) and [shared array buffers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer).\n        > - Go has incredible [goroutines and channels](https://go.dev/tour/concurrency/1).\n        > - Kotlin provides [coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html).\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcfa [**Multithreading Code - Computerphile** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/7ENFeb-J75k)\n2. \ud83d\udcfa [**Threading vs multiprocessing in Python** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/AZnGRKFUU0c)\n3. \ud83d\udcfa [**When is NodeJS Single-Threaded and when is it Multi-Threaded?** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/gMtchRodC2I)\n4. \ud83d\udcfa [**How to use Multithreading with \"worker threads\" in Node.js?** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/MuwJJrfIfsU)\n5. \ud83d\udcfa [**Concurrency in Go** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsc-VaxfZl4do3Etp_xQ0aQBoC-x5BIgJ)\n6. \ud83d\udcfa [**Kotlin coroutines** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQkwcJG4YTCQcFEPuYGuv54nYai_lwil_)\n7. \ud83d\udcc4 [**Multithreading in practice** \u2013 GitHub](https://github.com/thanhit95/multi-threading)\n </details>\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n-   ### Advanced Topics\n\n    -   [Garbage collector](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)>)\n        > A process that has made high-level languages very popular - it allows the programmer not to worry about memory allocation and freeing.

Clever people, of course, did not sit still and started to solve these problems, thus creating so-called patterns/principles/approaches for writing high-quality code.\n\n    By learning programming best practices, you will not only make things better for yourself, but also for others, because other developers will be working with your code.\n\n    -   [DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)\n    -   [KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)\n    -   [YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)\n    -   [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)\n    -   [GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)>)\n\n    For many languages there are special style guides and coding conventions.

A well-designed database will ensure long-term scalability and ease of data maintenance. There are several basic steps in database design:\n\n    - Definition of entities\n        > An entity is an object, concept, or event that has its own set of attributes. For example, if you're designing a database for a library, entities might include books, authors, publishers, and borrowers.\n    - Define the attributes to each entity\n        > Each entity has a set of specific attributes. For example, attributes of a book might include its title, author, ISBN, and publication date. Each attribute has a specific data type, be it a string, an integer, a boolaen, and so on.\n    - Add constraints\n        > Attribute values may have certain limitations. For example, strings can only be unique or have a limit on the maximum number of characters. \n    - Define relationships\n        > Entities can be linked to one another by one type of relationship: [one to one](https://vertabelo.com/blog/one-to-one-relationship-in-database/), [one to many](https://vertabelo.com/blog/one-to-many-relationship/) or [many to many](https://vertabelo.com/blog/many-to-many-relationship/). For example, a book might have one or more authors, and an author might write one or more books. You can represent these relationships by creating a foreign key in one table that references the primary key in another table. \n    - [Normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization)\n        > It is the process of separating data into separate related tables. Normalization eliminates [data redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_redundancy) and thus avoids data integrity violations when data changes.\n    - Optimize for performance\n        > Create indexes on frequently queried columns, tune the database configuration, and optimize the queries that you use to access the data.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcfa [**How to Create a Database Design From an Idea** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/5RpUmDEsn1k)\n2. \ud83d\udcfa [**Database Design Course - Learn how to design and plan a database for beginners** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/ztHopE5Wnpc)\n3. \ud83d\udcfa [**7 Database Design Mistakes to Avoid (With Solutions)** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/s6m8Aby2at8)\n4. \ud83d\udcc4 [**Dbdiagram \u2013 simple tool to draw ER diagrams**](https://dbdiagram.io/home)\n </details>\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n## API development\n\n[API (Application Programming Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) an interface which describes a certain set of rules by which different programs (applications, bots, websites...) can interact with each other. With API calls you can execute certain functions of a program without knowing how it works.\n\nWhen developing server applications, [different API formats](https://youtu.be/4vLxWqE94l4) can be used, depending on the tasks and requirements.\n\n-   ### REST API\n\n    [REST (Representational State Transfer)](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) an architectural approach that describes a set of rules for how a programmer organizes the writing of server application code so that all systems can easily exchange data and the application can be easily scaled. When building a REST API, HTTP protocol methods are widely used.\n\n    Basic rules for writing a good REST API:\n\n    -   Using HTTP methods\n        > As a rule, a single URL route is used to work on a particular data model (e.g. for users - `/api/user`). To perform different operations (get/create/edit/delete), this route must implement handlers for the corresponding HTTP methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE).\n    -   Use of plural names\n        > For example, a URL to retrieve one user by id looks like this: `/user/42`, and to retrieve all users like this: `/users`.\n    -   Sending the appropriate HTTP response codes\n        > The most commonly used: [200](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200), [201](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/201), [204](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/204), [304](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/304), [400](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400), [401](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/401), [403](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403), [404](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404), [405](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/405), [410](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/410), [415](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/415), [422](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/422), [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429).\n    -   [Versioning](https://github.com/NationalBankBelgium/REST-API-Design-Guide/wiki/REST-API-Versioning)\n        > Over time you may want or need to fundamentally change the way your REST API service works. To avoid breaking applications using the current version, you can leave it where it is and implement the new version over a different URL route, e.g. `/api/v2`.\n    \n    [API Design](https://twirl.github.io/The-API-Book/index.html)\n    > API development and design is a very important and responsible moment, as your API functionality will be used by other developers and systems to integrate with your service. Mistakes made during design can negatively affect not only the growth opportunities of your service, but also many others that depend on yours.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcc4 [**What Is Restful API?** \u2013 AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/?nc1=h_ls)\n2. \ud83d\udcfa [**What is REST API?** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/lsMQRaeKNDk)\n3. \ud83d\udcfa [**APIs for Beginners 2023 - How to use an API (Full Course)** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/WXsD0ZgxjRw)\n4. \ud83d\udcfa [**Build Web APIs with Python \u2013 Django REST Framework Course** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/tujhGdn1EMI)\n5. \ud83d\udcfa [**Build an API from Scratch with Node.js Express** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/-MTSQjw5DrM)\n6. \ud83d\udcfa [**Build REST API on Vanilla Node.js** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/_1xa8Bsho6A)\n7. \ud83d\udcfa [**Build a Rest API with GoLang** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/d_L64KT3SFM)\n8. \ud83d\udcfa [**Spring Kotlin - Building a Rest API Tutorial** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNnNHr-wCfobAxSkuxMqFGdpA8E5cLR6w)\n9. \ud83d\udcc4 [**REST API design full guide** \u2013 GitHub](https://github.com/NationalBankBelgium/REST-API-Design-Guide/wiki)\n10. \ud83d\udcc4 [**Awesome REST** \u2013 GitHub](https://github.com/marmelab/awesome-rest)\n </details>\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n-   ### GraphQL\n\n    [GraphQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL) is a query language and server-side runtime for APIs that allows you to retrieve and modify data from a server using a single URL endpoint.

With its API you can send a message to the server and receive a response without making an HTTP request, thereby implementing real-time communication.\n\n    The basic idea is that you do not need to send requests to the server for new information. When the connection is established, the server itself will send a new batch of data to connected clients as soon as that data is available. Web sockets are widely used to create chat rooms, online games, trading applications, etc.\n\n    -   Opening a web socket\n        > Sending an HTTP request with a specific set of headers: `Connection: Upgrade`, `Upgrade: websocket`, `Sec-WebSocket-Key`, `Sec-WebSocket-Version`.\n    -   Connection states\n        > `CONNECTING`, `OPEN`, `CLOSING`, `CLOSED`.\n    -   Events\n        > `Open`, `Message`, `Error`, `Close`.\n    -   Connection closing codes\n        > `1000`, `1001`, `1006`, `1009`, `1011`, [etc.](https://github.com/Luka967/websocket-close-codes)\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcfa [**A Beginner's Guide to WebSockets** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/8ARodQ4Wlf4)\n2. \ud83d\udcfa [**WebSockets Crash Course - Handshake, Use-cases, Pros & Cons and more** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/2Nt-ZrNP22A)\n3. \ud83d\udcc4 [**Introducing WebSockets - Bringing Sockets to the Web**](https://web.dev/websockets-basics)\n4. \ud83d\udcfa [**WebSockets with Python tutorial** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/lv0oEnQY1pM)\n5. \ud83d\udcfa [**WebSockets with Node.js tutorial** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/1BfCnjr_Vjg)\n6. \ud83d\udcfa [**WebSockets with Go tutorial** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/JuUAEYLkGbM)\n7. \ud83d\udcc4 [**Awesome WebSockets** \u2013 GitHub](https://github.com/facundofarias/awesome-websockets)\n </details>\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n-   ### RPC (Remote Procedure Call)\n\n    [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) is simply a function call to the server with a set of specific arguments, which returns the response usually encoded in a certain format, such as JSON or XML.

The idea is to combine groups of servers into clusters, where the load is distributed between them using special methods and algorithms, called balancing.\n\n    -   Balancing at the network level\n        > -   **DNS Balancing**. For one domain name is allocated several IP-addresses and the server to which the request will be redirected is determined by an algorithm [Round Robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS).\n        > -   **Building a [NLB cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/network-load-balancing)**. Used to manage two or more servers as one virtual cluster.\n        > -   **Balancing by territory**. An example is the [Anycast mailing method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast).\n    -   Balancing on the transport level\n        > Communication with the client is locked to the balancer, which acts as a proxy. It communicates with servers on its own behalf, passing information about the client in additional data and headers. Example \u2013 [HAProxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAProxy).\n    -   Balancing at the application level\n        > The balancer analyzes client requests and redirects them to different servers depending on the nature of the requested content. Examples are [Upstream module in Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html) (which is responsible for balancing) and [pgpool](https://www.pgpool.net/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) from the PostgreSQL database (for example, it can be used to distribute read requests to one server and write requests to another).\n    -   Balancing algorithms\n        > -   [**Round Robin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling). Each request is sent in turn to each server (first to the first, then to the second and so on in a circle).\n        > -   [**Weighted Round Robin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_round_robin). Improved algorithm Round Robin, which also takes into account the performance of the server.\n        > -   **Least Connections**. Each subsequent request is sent to the server with the smallest number of supported connections.\n        > -   **Destination Hash Scheduling**. The server that processes the request is selected from a static table based on the recipient's IP address.\n        > -   **Source Hash Scheduling**. The server that will process the request is selected from the table by the sender's IP address.\n        > -   [**Sticky Sessions**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/sticky-sessions.html). Requests are distributed based on the user's IP address. Sticky Sessions assumes that requests from the same client will be routed to the same server rather than bouncing around in a pool.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcfa [**What is a Load Balancer?** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/sCR3SAVdyCc)\n2. \ud83d\udcfa [**Learn Load Balancing right now** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/LlbTSfc4biw)\n3. \ud83d\udcfa [**Load Balancing with NGINX** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/a41jxGP9Ic8)\n4. \ud83d\udcfa [**Load Balancers id depth** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/galcDRNd5Ow)\n </details>\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n## Documentation\n\n-   ### Markdown\n\n    A standard in the development world.

So you can read the description of methods, functions, structures and so on right inside your IDE. As a rule, this kind of documentation is done in the form of ordinary comments, taking into account some syntactic peculiarities.\n\n    -   Why do you need it?\n        > To make your work and the work of other developers easier. In the long run this will save more time than _traveling through the code_ to figure out how everything works, what parameters to pass to functions or to find out what methods this or that class has. Over time you will inevitably forget your own code, so already written documentation will be useful to you personally.\n    -   What does it take to get started?\n        > For each language, it's different. Many have their own well-established approaches:\n        >\n        > -   [Docstring](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) for Python.\n        > -   [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc) for JavaScript.\n        > -   [Godoc](https://go.dev/doc/comment) for Go.\n        > -   [KDoc and Dokka](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-doc.html) for Kotlin.\n        > -   [Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc) for Java.\n        > -   And look for others on request: `documentation engine for <your lang>`.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcfa [**How To Use Developer Documentation** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/s1PLS3SQHQ0)\n2. \ud83d\udcfa [**How to use JSDoc - Basics & Introduction** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/Nqv6UkTROak)\n3. \ud83d\udcfa [**Godocs - Effortless documentation for your go packages** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/80VT3xexcWs)\n </details>\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n-   ### API Documentation\n\n    Easy-to-understand documentation will allow other users to understand and use your product faster. Writing documentation from scratch is a tedious process. There are common specifications and auto-generation tools to solve this problem.\n\n    -   [OpenAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification)\n        > A specification that describes how the API should be documented so that it is readable by humans and machines alike.\n    -   [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)\n        > A set of tools that allows you to create convenient API documentation based on the OpenAPI specification.\n    -   [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)\n        > A tool that allows you to automatically generate interactive documentation, which you can not only read but also actively interact with it (send HTTP requests).\n    -   [Swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)\n        > A kind of playground in which you can write documentation and immediately see the result of the generated page. You can use YAML or JSON format file for this.\n    -   [Swagger codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/)\n        > Allows you to automatically create API client libraries, server stubs and documentation.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcfa [**REST API and OpenAPI: It\u2019s Not an Either/Or Question** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/pRS9LRBgjYg)\n2. \ud83d\udcfa [**Swagger API documentation with Django REST Framework** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/fbIFdWj8PsY)\n3. \ud83d\udcfa [**NodeJS Swagger API Documentation Tutorial Using Swagger JSDoc** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/S8kmHtQeflo)\n4. \ud83d\udcfa [**Golang Microservices: REST APIs - OpenAPI / Swagger** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/HwtOAc0M08o)\n </details>\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n-   ### Static generators\n\n    Over time, when your project grows and has many modules, one README page on GitHub may not be enough. It will be appropriate to create a separate site for the documentation of your project. You don't need to learn how to make it, because there are many generators for creating nice-looking and handy documentation.\n\n    -   [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/)\n        > Probably the most popular documentation generator using GitHub/Git and Markdown.\n    -   [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)\n        > Open-source generator from Facebook (Meta).\n    -   [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)\n        > A simple and widely customizable Markdown documentation generator.\n    -   [Slate](https://slatedocs.github.io/slate)\n        > Minimalistic documentation generator for REST API.\n    -   [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org)\n        > Another simple, light and minimalistic static generator.\n    -   [Astro](https://astro.build/)\n        > A generator with a modern and advanced design.\n    -   [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)\n        > A static generator from the developers of the Rust language.\n    -   [And others...](https://jamstack.org/generators/)\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcfa [**Build a Markdown Documentation Site with Docusaurus (Step-by-Step)** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/2R53Y7eP45k)\n2. \ud83d\udcfa [**Create template layouts for your HTML with Astro SSG** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/o7iQAF2EvUU)\n </details>\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n## Building architecture\n\n-   ### Architectural patterns\n\n    -   [Layered](https://ducmanhphan.github.io/2020-02-20-Layered-architecture-pattern/)\n        > Used to structure programs that can be decomposed into groups of subtasks, each of which is at a particular level of abstraction.

This is the most common approach for building applications alone or with a small team.\n\n    -   Advantages:\n        > -   Ease of development (everything in one style and in one place). <br>\n        > -   Ease of deployment. <br>\n        > -   Easy to scale at the start.\n    -   Disadvantages:\n        > -   Increasing complexity (as the project grows, the entry threshold for new developers increases). <br>\n        > -   Time to assemble and start up is growing. <br>\n        > -   Making it harder to add new functionality that affects old functionality. <br>\n        > -   It is difficult (or impossible) to apply new technologies.\n\n    A microservice is also a complete application with a single code base. But, unlike a monolith, such an application is responsible for only one functional unit. That is, it is a small service that solves only one task, but well.\n\n    -   Advantages:\n        > -   Each individual microservice can have its own technology stack and be developed independently. <br>\n        > -   Easy to add new functionality (just create a new microservice). <br>\n        > -   A lower entry threshold for new developers. <br>\n        > -   Low time required for buildings and startups.\n    -   Disadvantages:\n        > -   The complexity of implementing interaction between all microservices. <br>\n        > -   More difficult to operate than several copies of the monolith. <br>\n        > -   Complexity of performing transactions. <br>\n        > -   Changes affecting multiple microservices must be coordinated.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcfa [**What are Microservices?** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/CdBtNQZH8a4)\n2. \ud83d\udcfa [**Microservices Explained and their Pros & Cons** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/T-m7ZFxeg1A)\n3. \ud83d\udcfa [**Microservice Architecture and System Design with Python & Kubernetes \u2013 Full Course** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/hmkF77F9TLw)\n4. \ud83d\udcfa [**NodeJS Microservices Full Course - Event-Driven Architecture with RabbitMQ** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/Zc2mQSQXoS4)\n5. \ud83d\udcfa [**Building Microservices in Go (playlist)** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7yAAGMOat_Fn8sAXIk0WyBfK_sT1pohu)\n6. \ud83d\udcc4 [**Awesome Microservices: collection of principles and technologies** \u2013 GitHub](https://github.com/mfornos/awesome-microservices)\n7. \ud83d\udcc4 [**Patterns for Microservices**](https://microservices.io/patterns/index.html)\n </details>\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n-   ### Horizontal and vertical scaling\n\n    <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"./files/building-architecture/horizontal-vertical-scaling_eng.png\" alt=\"Horizontal and vertical scaling\"/></p>\n\n    Over time, when the load on your application starts to grow (more users come, new functionality appears and, as a consequence, more CPU time is involved), it becomes necessary to increase the server capacity. There are [2 main approaches](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_(scale_out)_and_vertical_scaling_(scale_up)>) for this:\n\n    -   Vertical scaling\n        > It means increasing the capacity of the existing server. For example, this may include increasing the size of RAM, installing faster storage or increasing its volume, as well as the purchase of a new processor with a high clock frequency and/or a large number of cores and threads. Vertical scaling has its own limit, because we cannot increase the capacity of a single server for a long time.\n    -   Horizontal scaling\n        > The process of deploying new servers. This approach requires building a robust and scalable architecture that allows you to distribute the logic of the entire application across multiple physical machines.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\ud83d\udd17 <b>References</b></summary>\n\n1. \ud83d\udcfa [**System Design: What is Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling?** \u2013 YouTube](https://youtu.be/p1YQU5sEz4g)\n2. \ud83d\udcc4 [**Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling: Which one to choose**](https://middleware.io/blog/vertical-vs-horizontal-scaling/)\n </details>\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">Contents \u2b06\ufe0f</a></div>\n\n## Additional and similar resources\n\n-   [Backend Developer Roadmap: Learn to become a modern backend developer](https://roadmap.sh/backend)\n-   [Hussein Nasser \u2013 YouTube channel about network engineering](https://www.youtube.com/c/HusseinNasser-software-engineering)\n-   [A curated and opinionated list of resources for Backend developers](https://github.com/zhashkevych/awesome-backend)\n-   [Most important skills for Backend Developer](https://www.crio.do/blog/backend-development-career/)\n-   [System Design Course](https://github.com/karanpratapsingh/system-design)\n-   [Awesome Sysadmin: A curated list of open source sysadmin resources](https://github.com/awesome-foss/awesome-sysadmin)\n-   [Awesome Network Automation](https://github.com/networktocode/awesome-network-automation)\n-   [Computer Science courses with video lectures](https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses)\n-   [How To Secure A Linux Server](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server)\n-   [Mindmaps for cyber security](https://github.com/Ignitetechnologies/Mindmap)\n-   [Awesome CTO \u2013 resources for Chief Technology Officers and VP R&D](https://github.com/kuchin/awesome-cto)\n-   [Domain-Driven Design, software architecture, design patterns, best practices](https://github.com/Sairyss/domain-driven-hexagon)\n-   [Best practices, tools and guidelines for backend development](https://github.com/Sairyss/backend-best-practices)\n-   [Resources related to distributed systems, system design, microservices, scalability and performance](https://github.com/Sairyss/system-design-patterns)\n-   [System Design 101: Explain complex systems using visuals and simple terms](https://github.com/ByteByteGoHq/system-design-101)\n\n<p></p>\n<div align=\"center\">Made with \ud83d\udc99</div>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/cheatsnake/backend-cheats/blob/master/LICENSE\">LICENSE</a> 2022-Present</div\n"
