My PMS may offer fewer possibilities than those systems above, but it just does what I want it to do. Additionally, writing extensions is not too hard, depending on the logic required. Anyone with development knowledge can pretty much write their own extensions for personal needs.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Reasoning/Purpose</h3>\n<hr>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\n    I decided to create my own system, because playing around with tons of plugins for WordPress and writing customizations to some existing CRMs would take me as much time as writing my own system and by knowing the logic from its core it's easier for me to write extensions and add additional modules - whatever I need.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\n    Secondly, there is no system like that, and I didn't wanted to end up integrating a docker based cloud with CMS. Furthermore I just need an application like that to keep organized and I'm tired of having some very personal data on OneDrive, other data on Google cloud, some notes here, and some notes there. The end goal is to have an application running on terminal or raspberry 24/7 plugged into my home network, without access to internet.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Preview</h3>\n<hr>\t\n\n<img src=\"https://volmarg.github.io/img/project-example-dashboard.jpg\">\n\n<img src=\"https://volmarg.github.io/img/project-example-charts.jpg\">\n\n<img src=\"https://volmarg.github.io/img/project-example-contacts.jpg\">\n\n<h3>Available options and modules</h3>\n<hr>\n\n<ol>\n    <li><b style=\"display:inline\">\ud83c\udfaf Todo/Goals</b> - <span align=\"justify\"><i>Keep a track of your personal goals.

I've got a job, personal things etc, I'm just sharing my code/my application as MIT. However feel totally free to ask about something, write issues etc. As mentioned I'm using and I will use this application from now on daily so there might be some changes even good for me.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\n    As I'm working on it there will be some fixes, and new modules in future when I reach the point when I got all I need.

Just <b>Chrome</b>. I know about bug with copying password in Firefox for example. But I just do everything in Chrome so I'm not really planning to check that on other browsers. And before You ask why I only support chrome - I don't do it because of \"chrome is the best\" or anything like that, I just use that browser for 98% of time and that's just it.\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Tech</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n    Personal Management System is a web application which can be ran either in Windows and Linux enviroment.
