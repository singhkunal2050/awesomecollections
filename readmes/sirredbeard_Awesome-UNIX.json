[More...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix)\n\n### Why is UNIX\u00ae relevant today?\n\nThe ideas behind UNIX\u00ae, a research operating system from AT&T in the 1960s, have evolved to form a set of core [computer science principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) around which dozens of operating systems are built. These operating systems and applications built on them underpin most of modern computing, from the mobile devices in your pocket to mainframes that perform climate change analysis. They exist on a continuum that includes certified UNIX\u00ae, open source projects descended from the original AT&T UNIX\u00ae, and Unix-like projects designed to be Unix-compatible. [More...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix#Impact)\n\n### Disambiguation: AT&T UNIX\u00ae, UNIX\u00ae Certification, UNIX\u00ae-Like, and Linux\u00ae\n\n<img src=\"./venn_diagram.svg\" alt=\"Venn diagram\" title=\"Venn diagram illustrating similarities between notable families of Unix and Unix-like platforms\" width=\"600\"/>\n\n#### Commercial UNIX\u00ae\n\nUNIX\u00ae was originally a research operating system developed at AT&T's Bell Labs.\u00ae It has evolved today into a set of operating systems standards, called [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)\u00ae overseen by the [IEEE\u00ae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX), and official sets of certification that can be obtained by companies for their commercial operating systems, through a process administrated by The Open Group\u00ae. Among the [operating systems certified as UNIX](https://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/) are massive mainframe operating systems like IBM\u00ae's AIX\u00ae as well Apple\u00ae's macOS\u00ae desktop operating for their MacBook\u00ae and iMac\u00ae lineup.\n\n#### \"Unix Philosophy\"\n\n\"Unix philosophy\" is a core set of computer science principles, first implemented in UNIX\u00ae, now codified in standards set forth by IEEE\u00ae and The Open Group\u00ae, and duplicated in dozens of UNIX\u00ae-like operating systems that emphasize building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible software on a common set of programming standards and libraries that allow that software to be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators, across numerous operating systems and platforms. This enables the rapid spread and development of new and better software. It goes hand in hand with [open source philosophy](https://opensource.org/osd-annotated).\n\n> \"This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.\" - *Douglas McIlroy, former head of Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center*\n\n#### AT&T UNIX\u00ae-Derived Descendants, e.g FreeBSD\u00ae\n\nThe term UNIX also debatedbly encompasses operating systems that are direct descendants of the original AT&T UNIX codebase but have since [re-implemented the AT&T code with code under open source licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution). The most prominent of which the family of BSDs: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD, and their derivatives. These are not UNIX\u00ae certified, they are technically Unix-like, but share a unique direct link back to AT&T UNIX\u00ae, while newcomers like Redox OS do not.\n\n#### Unix\u00ae-Like Operating Systems, e.g. Linux\u00ae\n\nFor a variety of historical and legal reasons, there has also been a massive explosion of *Unix-like* operating systems. MINIX\u00ae, for example, was created as a Unix-like teaching operating system by Prof. Andrew S. Tanenbaum. Linux\u00ae was created because Linus Torvalds, a college student, [wanted to run a Unix-like operating system](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html) on his own hardware. Linux\u00ae has since gone on to become the most popular Unix-like operating system. Twenty years later, when Android, Inc.\u00ae needed a kernel for their new namesake mobile operating system they borrowed one from Linux. Unix-like operating systems implement some degree of the POSIX\u00ae standards and Unix philosophy but do not seek official UNIX\u00ae certification.\n\n----------\n\n# *NIXes\n\n## Certified UNIX\u00ae Operating Systems\ud83d\udcb0\n\n* [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/)\u00ae - macOS is the current series of Unix-based graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. designed to run on Apple's personal computers. \n* [AIX](https://www.ibm.com/power/operating-systems/aix)\u00ae - AIX is a series of proprietary Unix operating systems developed and sold by IBM for several of its computer platforms. \n* [HP-UX](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/servers/hp-ux.html)\u00ae - HP-UX is  Hewlett Packard Enterprise's proprietary implementation of the Unix operating system, based on UNIX System V.\n* [UnixWare](https://www.xinuos.com)\u00ae - UnixWare is a Unix operating system made by Xinuos from the assets of SCO Group.\n* [OpenServer](https://www.xinuos.com/products/openserver-6/)\u00ae - OpenServer is a Unix operating system made by Xinuos from the assets of SCO Group.\n* [z/OS](https://www.ibm.com/products/zos)\u00ae - IBM z/OS is an operating system for IBM zSystems mainframes.\n\n#### [Get More macOS](#more-macos)\n\n## AT&T UNIX\u00ae-Derived Operating Systems ![Open Source][OSS Icon]\n\nThese operating systems, with the exception of Open Server 10, are not UNIX\u00ae certified by The Open Group.\n\n* [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org) - OpenBSD is a free and open-source Unix-like computer operating system descended from Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Research Unix derivative developed at the University of California, Berkeley known for it's security and development discipline.\n\t* [FuguIta](http://fuguita.org/?FuguIta) - FuguIta is an OpenBSD live CD featuring portable workplace, low hardware requirements, additional software, and partial support for Japanese. \n\t* [MirBSD](http://www.mirbsd.org) - Fork of OpenBSD that tracks OpenBSD base with a number of enhancements and modifications.\n* [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org)\u00ae - NetBSD is a free and open source Unix-like operating system that descends from Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Research Unix derivative developed at the University of California, Berkeley known for it's wideranging platform support. \n* [DragonflyBSD](https://www.dragonflybsd.org) - DragonFly BSD is a free and open source Unix-like operating system created as a fork of FreeBSD 4.8.\n* [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org)\u00ae - FreeBSD is a free and open-source Unix\u00ae-like operating system descended from Research Unix via the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) known for it's software package availability and speed.\n\t* [TrueOS](https://www.trueos.org)\u00ae - TrueOS (formerly PC-BSD or PCBSD) was a Unix\u00ae-like, desktop-oriented operating system built upon the most recent releases of FreeBSD.
