Bitcoin Redux explains what\u2019s going wrong in the world of cryptocurrencies. The bitcoin exchanges are developing into a shadow banking system, which do not give their customers actual bitcoin but rather display a \"balance\" and allow them to transact with others. However if Alice sends Bob a bitcoin, and they\u2019re both customers of the same exchange, it just adjusts their balances rather than doing anything on the blockchain. This is an e-money service, according to European law, but is the law enforced? Not where it matters.

Why state backed money is a good thing (a feature not a bug).\n  > If you've spent much time around cryptocurrency people, you've probably heard a rant or two about \"sound money\" and the need to \"depoliticize money.\" This is a foundation of blockchainism: the belief that money is born separate from states, and states invade on the private realm when they \"meddle\" in the money system.\n  >\n  > There are at least two serious problems with this ideology. First, it's plain wrong on the historical facts. Money did not emerge from barter systems among people. Money was and is a product of state.\n  >\n  > But even if you stipulate that money didn't originate among private markets there's another serious historical problem with \"sound money.\" ... It's this: central banks didn't emerge to usurp the private sector's control over money. Central banks were created because without them, finance was subject to wild, terrifying, ruinous boom/bust cycles. What's more, without a central bank, money was subject to naked political meddling, which central banks (sometimes) moderated.\n* Internet pioneer/Silicon Valley legend Tim O'Reilly on Web3:\n  - [Why it\u2019s too early to get excited about Web3](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/why-its-too-early-to-get-excited-about-web3/) - 2021-12-13\n  - [\"Get ready for the crash\"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cryptocurrency-nft-blockchain-web3-tim-oreilly/) - CBS Money Watch - 2022-02-09\n  - [Crypto and NFTs are \"Pretty Serious Speculative Bubble\"](https://decrypt.co/92676/internet-guru-tim-oreilly-crypto-nfts-serious-speculative-bubble) - 2022-02-10\n* [David Rosenthal: Can We Mitigate Cryptocurrencies' Externalities?](https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/ee380-talk.html) - 2022-02-09.

Summary of critique:\n  > * That the externalities I describe don't exist. You'll have a hard time proving that the waste of electricity and hardware, and the crime wave, are imaginary.\n  > * That although the externalities do exist, the benefits of decentralization outweigh them. The problem here is that since the systems are not actually decentralized, we get the externalities but don't get the benefits.\n  > * That although the externalities do exist, and the systems aren't dencentralized, they're making so much money that we shouldn't worry. The problem here is that the amount of actual money you can get out of a cryptocurrency equals the amount of actual money that has been put in, minus the actual costs of mining. So the big picture is that although there may be winners, in aggregate the system loses money.\n  * [Economies of Scale in Peer-to-Peer Networks](https://blog.dshr.org/2014/10/economies-of-scale-in-peer-to-peer.html) - 2014-10-07.

It replaces voluntary compliance with a corporation\u2019s charter under threat of lawsuit, with automated compliance with software defined rules. This subtle change may be enough to bypass regulatory hurdles facing traditional trustee\u2019s and administrators, but it doesn\u2019t solve most of the problems the regulations were attempting to address.\n  >\n  > What The DAO doesn\u2019t solve is all of the other problems inherent with any joint venture.

The Internet stack, in terms of how value is distributed, is composed of \u201cthin\u201d protocols and \u201cfat\u201d applications.\n>\n> This relationship between protocols and applications is reversed in the blockchain application stack. Value concentrates at the shared protocol layer and only a fraction of that value is distributed along at the applications layer. It\u2019s a stack with \u201cfat\u201d protocols and \u201cthin\u201d applications.\n\n* [Crypto Tokens and the Coming Age of Protocol Innovation](https://continuations.com/post/148098927445/crypto-tokens-and-the-age-of-protocol-innovation) - 2016-07-28 - by Albert Wenger at USV.
