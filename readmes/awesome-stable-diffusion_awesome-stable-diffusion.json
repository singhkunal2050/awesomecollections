Operation requires an API Key (\ud83d\udd8a\ufe0f\ud83d\udcb5).\n* [Public Release Announcement](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) - StabilityAI's announcement about the public release of Stable Diffusion.\n* \ud83d\udd8a\ufe0f [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/stablediffusion) - The official Stable Diffusion Discord by StabilityAI.\n* [laion-aesthetic](https://laion-aesthetic.datasette.io/laion-aesthetic-6pls/images) - The dataset used train stable diffusion, useful for querying to see if a concept is represented. \n\n## Actively Maintained Forks and Containers\n\nAll forks listed here add additional features and optimisations and are generally faster than the original release, as they keep the model in memory rather than reloading it after every prompt. Most forks seem to remove the Safety Classifier which may present a risk if used to provide public-facing services, such as Discord bots. The two most popular forks at this point are Automatic1111 and InvokeAI\n\n* [AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker](https://github.com/AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker) - Easy Docker setup for SD with multiple user-friendly UI options including [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), [sd-webui/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/sd-webui/stable-diffusion-webui) and [invoke-ai/InvokeAI](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI).\n\n* [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) - Likely the fastest moving, most feature rich branch at the moment. Gradio based UI with extensive features such as in and outpainting, previews, xy plots, upscaling, clip-interrogation, textual inversion, negative prompting, a variety of upscaling features, training, checkpoint merging and switching capabilities and more. Comes with a handy install script that takes care of most dependencies and addons. \n\n* [basujindal/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/basujindal/stable-diffusion) - \"Optimized Stable Diffusion\"\u2014a fork with dramatically reduced VRAM requirements through model splitting, enabling Stable Diffusion on lower-end graphics cards; includes a GradIO web interface and support for weighted prompts. \n\n* [bes-dev/stable_diffusion.openvino](https://github.com/bes-dev/stable_diffusion.openvino) - A fork for running the model using a CPU compatible with OpenVINO.\n* [DreamArtist](https://github.com/7eu7d7/DreamArtist-stable-diffusion) - With just one training image DreamArtist learns the content and style in it, generating diverse high-quality images with high controllability.

Also includes upscaling, facial restoration via CodeFormer and [custom UI](https://github.com/neonsecret/stable-diffusion/blob/main/GUI_TUTORIAL.md)\n\n\n\n## Checkpoints and Weights\n\nCheckpoints (.ckpt files) must be separately downloaded and are required to run Stable Diffusion. The latest stability ai release is 2.1. The last model containing NSFW concepts was 1.5 released by RunwayML.\n\nFor 2.x releases, there is a 768x768px resolution capable model trained off the base model (512x512 pixels).
