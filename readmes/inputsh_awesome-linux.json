In those categories, the distributions are organized in the alphabetical order.\n\n### Beginners\n\n#### [elementary OS](http://elementary.io/)\n\n> elementary OS is an Ubuntu-based desktop distribution. Some of its more interesting features include a custom desktop environment called Pantheon and many custom apps including Photos, Music, Videos, Calendar, Terminal, Files, and more. It also comes with some familiar apps like the Epiphany web browser and a fork of Geary mail. \n\n**Latest version:** elementary OS Juno (5.0)\n\n**Default Desktop Environment:** Pantheon\n\n![default look](https://elementary.io/images/screenshots/desktop.jpg)\n\n#### [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)\n\n> Fedora (formerly Fedora Core) is a Linux distribution developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and owned by Red Hat. Fedora contains software distributed under a free and open-source license and aims to be on the leading edge of such technologies. Fedora has a reputation for focusing on innovation, integrating new technologies early on and working closely with upstream Linux communities. The default desktop in Fedora is the GNOME desktop environment and the default interface is the GNOME Shell. Other desktop environments, including KDE, Xfce, LXDE, MATE and Cinnamon, are available. Fedora Project also distributes custom variations of Fedora called Fedora spins. These are built with specific sets of software packages, offering alternative desktop environments or targeting specific interests such as gaming, security, design, scientific computing and robotics.\n\n**Latest version:** Fedora Twenty Nine (29)\n\n**Default Desktop Environment:** GNOME\n\n![default look](https://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/fedora.png)\n\n#### [Linux Mint](http://linuxmint.com/)\n\n> Linux Mint is an Ubuntu-based distribution whose goal is to provide a more complete out-of-the-box experience by including browser plugins, support for DVD playback, Java and other components.

This operating system is called Debian. Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel. Linux is a completely free piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide. Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 50,000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine) - all of it free. It's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian -- carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together. \n\n**Latest version:** Debian Stretch (9.6)\n\n**Default Desktop Environment:** GNOME\n\n![default look](http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/debian.png)\n\n#### [Mageia](http://www.mageia.org/)\n\n> Mageia is a fork of Mandriva Linux formed in September 2010 by former employees and contributors to the popular French Linux distribution. Unlike Mandriva, which is a commercial entity, the Mageia project is a community project and a non-profit organisation whose goal is to develop a free Linux-based operating system.\n\n**Latest version:** Mageia 6.1\n\n**Default Desktop Environment:** KDE\n\n![default look](http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/mageia.png)\n\n#### [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)\n\n> Manjaro Linux is a fast, user-friendly, desktop-oriented operating system based on Arch Linux. Key features include intuitive installation process, automatic hardware detection, stable rolling-release model, ability to install multiple kernels, special Bash scripts for managing graphics drivers and extensive desktop configurability. Manjaro Linux offers Xfce as the core desktop options, as well as a minimalist Net edition for more advanced users. Community-supported GNOME 3/Cinnamon and KDE flavours are available. Users also benefit from the supportive and vibrant Manjaro community forum.\n\n**Latest version:** Manjaro 18.0.2\n\n**Default Desktop Environment:** XFCE, KDE\n\n![default look](http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/manjaro.png)\n\n#### [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/)\n\n> The openSUSE project is a community program sponsored by SUSE Linux and other companies. Promoting the use of Linux everywhere, this program provides free, easy access to openSUSE, a complete Linux distribution. The openSUSE project has three main goals: make openSUSE the easiest Linux for anyone to obtain and the most widely used Linux distribution; leverage open source collaboration to make openSUSE the world's most usable Linux distribution and desktop environment for new and experienced Linux users; dramatically simplify and open the development and packaging processes to make openSUSE the platform of choice for Linux developers and software vendors. \n\n**Latest version:** openSUSE Leap 15.0 and openSUSE Tumbleweed (Rolling Release system)\n\n**Default Desktop Environment:** KDE, GNOME, XFCE, LXDE (Choose on installation)\n\n![default look](http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/opensuse.png)\n\n### Advanced\n\n#### [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)\n\n> Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86_64-optimised Linux distribution targeted at competent Linux users. It uses 'pacman', its home-grown package manager, to provide updates to the latest software applications with full dependency tracking. Operating on a rolling release system, Arch can be installed from a CD image or via an FTP server. The default install provides a solid base that enables users to create a custom installation. In addition, the Arch Build System (ABS) provides a way to easily build new packages, modify the configuration of stock packages, and share these packages with other users via the Arch Linux user repository.\n\n**Latest version:** Not applicable (Rolling Release system)\n\n**Default Desktop Environment:** Not applicable (there's no default Desktop environment)\n\n### Special Purpose\n\n#### [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/)\n\n**Specialty:** Clusters\n\n> CoreOS is a Linux-based operating system for servers. Built from the ground up and designed primarily for the modern data centre, CoreOS provides specialist tools for making the system secure, reliable and up-to-date.

What's different here is that Puppy is extraordinarily small, yet quite full-featured. Puppy boots into a ramdisk and, unlike live CD distributions that have to keep pulling stuff off the CD, it loads into RAM. This means that all applications start in the blink of an eye and respond to user input instantly. Puppy Linux has the ability to boot off a flash card or any USB memory device, CDROM, Zip disk or LS/120/240 Superdisk, floppy disks, internal hard drive. It can even use a multisession formatted CD-RW/DVD-RW to save everything back to the CD/DVD with no hard drive required at all.\n\n#### [Ubuntu Studio](http://ubuntustudio.org/)\n\n**Specialty:** Multimedia creation\n\n> Ubuntu Studio is a variant of Ubuntu aimed at the GNU/Linux audio, video and graphic enthusiast as well as professional. The distribution provides a collection of open-source applications available for multimedia creation.\n\n#### [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html)\n\n**Specialty:** Incognito live system\n\n> Tails is a live system that aims to preserve your privacy and anonymity. It helps you to use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leaving no trace unless you ask it to explicitly. It is a complete operating system designed to be used from a USB stick or a DVD independently of the computer's original operating system. It is Free Software and based on Debian GNU/Linux.
