However, with the open source code comes open source vulnerabilities. Dependency management tools help manage vulnerabilities in open source packages by identifying and updating packages with known vulnerabilities.\n\n- [Deepfence ThreatMapper](https://github.com/deepfence/ThreatMapper) - Apache v2, powerful runtime vulnerability scanner for kubernetes, virtual machines and serverless.\n- [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) - _GitHub_ - Automatically scan GitHub repositories for vulnerabilities and create pull requests to merge in patched dependencies.\n- [Dependency-Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/) - _OWASP_ - Scans dependencies for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities using CLI or build server plugins.\n- [Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/) - _OWASP_ - Monitor the volume and severity of vulnerable dependencies across multiple projects over time.\n- [JFrog XRay](https://jfrog.com/xray/) - _JFrog_ - Security and compliance analysis for artifacts stored in JFrog Artifactory.\n- [NPM Audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit) - _NPM_ - Vulnerable package auditing for node packages built into the npm CLI.\n- [Renovate](https://renovate.whitesourcesoftware.com/) - _WhiteSource_ - Automatically monitor and update software dependencies for multiple frameworks and languages using a CLI or git repository apps.\n- [Requires.io](https://requires.io/) - _Olivier Mansion & Alexis Tabary_ - Automated vulnerable dependency monitoring and upgrades for Python projects.\n- [Snyk Open Source](https://snyk.io/) - _Snyk_ - Automated vulnerable dependency monitoring and upgrades using Snyk's dedicated vulnerability database.\n\n### Dynamic Analysis\n\nDynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST) is a form of black-box security testing where a security scanner interacts with a running instance of an application, emulating malicious activity to find common vulnerabilities. DAST tools are commonly used in the initial phases of a penetration test, and can find vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection, cross-site request forgery and information disclosure.\n\n- [Automatic API Attack Tool](https://github.com/imperva/automatic-api-attack-tool) - _Imperva_ - Perform automated security scanning against an API based on an API specification.\n- [BurpSuite Enterprise Edition](https://portswigger.net/burp/enterprise) - _PortSwigger_ - BurpSuite's web application vulnerability scanner used widely by penetration testers, modified with CI/CD integration and continuous monitoring over multiple web applications.\n- [Gauntlt](https://github.com/gauntlt/gauntlt) - _Gauntlt_ - A Behaviour Driven Development framework to run security scans using common security tools and test output, defined using Gherkin syntax.\n- [Netz](https://github.com/spectralops/netz) - _Spectral_ - Discover internet-wide misconfigurations, using zgrab2 and others.\n- [SSL Labs Scan](https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan) - _SSL Labs_ - Automated scanning for SSL / TLS configuration issues.\n- [Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) - _OWASP_ - An open-source web application vulnerability scanner, including an API for CI/CD integration.\n\n### Infrastructure as Code Analysis\n\nInfrastructure as Code allows applications to be deployed reliably to a consistent environment. This not only ensures that infrastructure is consistently hardened, but also provides an opportunity to statically and dynamically analyse infrastructure definitions for vulnerable dependencies, hard-coded secrets, insecure configuration and unintentional changes in security configuration. The following tools facilitate this analysis.\n\n#### Multi-Platform\n\n- [Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov) - _Bridgecrew_ - Scan Terraform, AWS CloudFormation and Kubernetes templates for insecure configuration.\n- [KICS](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics) - _Checkmarx_ - Find security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations early in the development cycle.\n- [Spectral DeepConfig](https://spectralops.io/blog/spectral-launches-deepconfig-to-ensure-no-misconfiguration-at-all-layers-of-software/) - _Spectral_ - Find misconfiguration both in infrastructure as well as apps as early as commit time.\n- [Terrascan](https://github.com/accurics/terrascan) - _Accurics_ - Detect compliance and security violations across Infrastructure as Code to mitigate risk before provisioning cloud native infrastructure.\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n#### Cloud Formation\n- [Cfn Nag](https://github.com/stelligent/cfn_nag) - _Stelligent_ - Scan AWS CloudFormation templates for insecure configuration.\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n#### Containers\n- [Anchore Engine](https://anchore.com/opensource/) - _Anchore, Inc_ - Deep inspection of Docker images for CVEs and checking against custom policies.

We must also monitor our production software for usage, performance and errors to capture malicious behavior and potential security flaws that we may need to respond to or address. A wide variety of tools are available to monitor different aspects of production software and infrastructure.\n\n- [Csper](https://csper.io/report-uri) - _Csper_ - A set of Content Security Policy tools that can test policies, monitor CSP reports and provide metrics and alerts.\n\n### Secrets Management\n\nThe software we write needs to use secrets (passwords, API keys, certificates, database connection strings) to access resources, yet we cannot store secrets within the codebase as this leaves them vulnerable to compromise. Secret management tools provide a means to securely store, access and manage secrets.\n\n- [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html) - _Ansible_ - Securely store secrets within Ansible pipelines.\n- [AWS Key Management Service (KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) - _Amazon AWS_ - Create and manage cryptographic keys in AWS.\n- [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) - _Amazon AWS_ - Securely store retrievable application secrets in AWS.\n- [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/key-vault/) - _Microsoft Azure_ - Securely store secrets within Azure.\n- [BlackBox](https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox) - _StackExchange_ - Encrypt credentials within your code repository.\n- [Chef Vault](https://github.com/chef/chef-vault) - _Chef_ - Securely store secrets within Chef.\n- [CredStash](https://github.com/fugue/credstash) - _Fugue_ - Securely store secrets within AWS using KMS and DynamoDB.\n- [CyberArk Application Access Manager](https://www.cyberark.com/products/privileged-account-security-solution/application-access-manager/) - _CyberArk_ - Secrets management for applications including secret rotation and auditing.\n- [Docker Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) - _Docker_ - Store and manage access to secrets within a Docker swarm.\n- [Git Secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) - _Amazon AWS_ - Scan git repositories for secrets committed within code or commit messages.\n- [Gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) - _Gopass_ - Password manager for teams relying on Git and gpg.
