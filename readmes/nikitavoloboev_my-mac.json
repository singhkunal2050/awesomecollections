Below is a list of my favorite tools with descriptions of how I use them.\n\nI also share [my config](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/config) together with my [iOS setup](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios). And I made a [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BBKnQU4_rty6_942PFbPbw) to discuss all things macOS/iOS.\n\nI have [extensive wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev) where I share [everything I know](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/sharing/everything-I-know). I go in detail about how I use each of the apps in the wiki. Not to duplicate the content, I simply link to the wiki from here as the wiki will always be up to date.\n\nMy workflow in general is described in detail [here](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/sharing/my-workflow).\n\n### Changing themes\n\nI made [KM macro](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros) with [this AppleScript](https://www.macobserver.com/tips/quick-tip/change-light-dark-mode-applescript-app/) to switch [between light/dark macOS appearances](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1311336647338983432). As appearances are switched, the themes get updated accordingly on most apps.\n\n### Productivity\n\n<!-- - [KusKus](https://kuskus.app) for personal tasks. It has great onscreen keybinds. AI suggestions. Easily change priority or assign tasks to a tag. -->\n\n- [Karabiner](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/karabiner/) is essential tool I use to remap my keyboard. It's the tool on which my entire mac workflow is built. Essentially all the keys on my keyboard are dual purpose keys. Press once, it enters the key, hold together with another key and do custom action. I have 100's of these custom actions all within 1 second of activation for me.\n- [Alfred](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/alfred) for everything search related. I create many custom plugins to do specific searches I need. Also use [Raycast](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/raycast) & [Script Kit](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/scriptkit) (at times).\n- [Keyboard Maestro](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/) for all automation needs that are not search related. Both Alfred/Raycast/ScriptKit and KM are activated from Karabiner directly. I share all my KM macros [here](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros).\n<!-- - [Height](https://height.app) for project & personal [goals](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/focusing/goals) management. It's one of my main tools to [break down problems as I solve them](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/research/solving-problems) in team or personal setting. -->\n- [1Password](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/1password) use it to keep all passwords and secret info. I prefer to use Single Sign On via GitHub or Google as I do dislike keeping track of passwords.\n- [BetterTouchTool](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/bettertouchtool) use it for custom trackpad gestures. Specifically love three finger swipe left/right to move between tabs in [Safari](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/web/browsers/safari). Three finger swipe up to create new tab. Three down to close. Four finger swipe global swipe to show Safari. Four to right to open [VSCode](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/text-editors/vs-code). Four left to open [Warp](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/unix/shell/warp).\n- [Fantastical](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/fantastical) use to manage my calendar and events.\n- [Dictionary](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/dictionary/welcome/mac) surprisingly useful to [quickly search Wikipedia](https://i.imgur.com/wFkJXwd.png).\n- [CleanShot](https://getcleanshot.com) use it for quick editing of screenshots.\n- [Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com/) is great [BitTorrent](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/networking/peer-to-peer/bittorrent) client.\n- [Notion](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/notion) is useful to manage team wikis or share documents with others. Don't like using it as my general knowledge management tool.\n- [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) use it to read all my [RSS](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/web/rss) feeds.\n- [Obsidian](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/obsidian) use it for [note taking](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/other/wiki-workflow). Love its linking complete feature and various plugins it has.\n\n### Code\n\n- [Cursor Nightly](https://www.cursor.sh/) is my main editor. It is a fork of [VS Code](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/text-editors/vs-code) but gives nice AI features I use often. Use many [VSCode extensions](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/text-editors/vs-code/vs-code-extensions) with it. Keep my UI minimal and useful.\n- [Sublime Text](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/text-editors/sublime-text) use it for [quick edits of markdown, specifically my wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/other/wiki-workflow). It opens up instantly and is joy to edit in. Have custom [KM macros](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros) such as quickly creating markdown links and other little useful actions.\n- [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com) use it as visual Git client. It gives nice overview of files changed, what branches exist and more. I have custom actions bound to go through Git tasks fast. I also use [gitupdate](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/gitupdate) for throwaway commits either on PR branches where main commit will be written when squashed or some random doc related repos.\n- [Warp](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/unix/shell/warp) use it my primary terminal together with [Fish Shell](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/unix/shell/fish).\n- [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) use it to [search for APIs fast](https://i.imgur.com/P5LQaLz.png). Use it through [Alfred workflow](https://www.alfredapp.com/blog/productivity/dash-quicker-api-documentation-search/).\n- [Pathfinder](https://pathfinder.dev/) for GraphQL requests (use [Grafbase](https://grafbase.com)). And [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/) for regular HTTP requests\n- [Xcode](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/xcode/) use it to build [iOS](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/operating-systems/ios) apps in [SwiftUI](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/programming-languages/swift/swift-libraries/swiftui).\n- [Ducklet](https://ducklet.app/) for [SQLite](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/databases/sqlite) queries. [Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/) for everything else.\n\n### Social\n\n- [Telegram](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/telegram) use it as my main messenger and absolutely love it. Love its stickers, the speed and honestly everything about it.\n- [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com) use it as my email client. Does good job of sorting mail and getting out of my way when writing/replying to things.\n- [Discord](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/discord) use it the main way to interact with various communities. Much better than [Slack](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/slack) as it keeps the history forever and recently added a nice Forum feature better question asking.\n\n### Design\n\n- [Figma](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/design/figma) use it as my primary design tool.\n\n### Music\n\n- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) use it to stream all [my music](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/music). Keep all my liked songs in a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ERn0U4qZIKC8Dy7RrMMsn).\n\n### Video\n\n- [IINA](https://github.com/lhc70000/iina) use it to play video files of movies/series.\n\n### Browsers\n\n- [Safari](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/web/browsers/safari) spend majority of time on mac in the app.\n- [Google Chrome Canary](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/web/browsers/google-chrome) use Canary over regular as I don't use Chrome for browsing but for development as its [dev tools](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/web/browsers/google-chrome/chrome-dev-tools) are superior. Sometimes canary builds break so I go to regular Chrome.\n- [Safari Technology Preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/) use it only for browsing [Twitter](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/twitter) and sometimes dev. Have 2 feeds open in tab 1/2 and have bind `space+k` to instantly open it.\n\n## Command Line Apps\n\nUse [Brew](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/package-managers/brew) and global [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) packages for most of my CLIs. Although eventually want to settle down on [Nix](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/package-managers/nix) as I learn it more.\n\nI try to keep my macOS declarative. Currently it's a [Go file](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/config/blob/master/magefile.go) in my [config](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/config) and is not up to date.\n\nI list CLIs I use [here](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/cli).\n\n## [My iOS](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios)\n\nIf you found this interesting, I also have [similar repository](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios) going over what applications I use on iOS/WatchOS as well as how and why I use them.\n\n<a align=\"center\" href=\"https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios\">\n    <img width=\"250\" heigth=\"400\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios/main/1.jpeg\"></a>\n\n<a align=\"center\" href=\"https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios\">\n    <img width=\"250\" heigth=\"400\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios/main/2.jpeg\"></a>\n\n<a align=\"center\" href=\"https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios\">\n    <img width=\"250\" heigth=\"400\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios/main/3.jpeg\"></a>\n\n## Similar Setups\n\nHere you can find more setups by other people that you can take ideas and inspiration from.\n\n- [Works for me](https://works-for-me.github.io/) - Collection of developer toolkits.\n- [Use This Interviews](https://usesthis.com) - What do people use to get stuff done?\n- [Omar Bahareth's my-mac-os](https://github.com/obahareth/my-mac-os) - Another my-mac-os.\n\n## Related\n\n- [Awesome mac](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/awesome-mac)\n- [Interesting macOS apps](https://github.com/learn-anything/macos-apps)\n- [Open Source macOS apps](https://github.com/serhii-londar/open-source-mac-os-apps)\n\n## Contribute\n\n[Suggestions](../../issues/) are welcome. \u2728\n\n[Open new issue](../../issues/new/choose) or [start discussion](../../discussions).\n\nJoin [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TVafwaD23d) for more indepth discussions on this repo and [others](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev#src).\n\n### \u2665\ufe0f\n\n[Support on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev) or look into [other projects](https://nikiv.dev/projects).\n\n[![MIT](http://bit.ly/mitbadge)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) [![Twitter](http://bit.ly/nikitatweet)](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev)\n"
