[y/N] y \n    $ls -l\n    ```\n  - Build and edit YAMLs using natural language e.g. Kubernetes and other form of config files\n    - [Kor](eyurtsev.github.io/kor/) for ideas on how this is done for JSON\n    - Can be use-case specific. Build pipelines? Kube?\n    \n  - Mobile Android/iOS SDK for Stable Diffusion inference\n    -  Apple has released a [CoreML Stable Diffusion Inference](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion)\n\n- **Voice powered Experiences**\n  - Audio Conversation with chatGPT, can combine with fast Text-to-Speech e.g. [Eleven Labs](https://elevenlabs.io) to have a two-way conversation\n  - Telegram/WhatsApp bot to get audio and save as text with metadata into mem.ai or Roam Research or Obsidian\n\n- Edit image by giving instructions of what you want to do: [SeeChatGPT](https://github.com/Nischaydnk/SeeChatGPT) and [playgroundai.com](playgroundai.com) as examples\n  - The underlying mechanism which you can use is called [InstructPix2Pix](huggingface.co/spaces/timbrooks/instruct-pix2pix)\n  \n- Semantic search over any media\n  - Can build using CLIP or [BLIP-2 embeddings](huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/blip-2) for images and [CLAP](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP/tree/clap#quick-start) for all audio including music and speech\n\n- Text to Music Generation\n  - See [MusicLM](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/) for reference\n  \n- **Knowledge Base QA** aka Answer Engines\n\n  - Take any plaintext dataset e.g. State of the Union address and build on top of that \n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3250749/223094577-8126570b-f7a4-48ad-9f77-ff86a8b21161.png)\n  - Can use this over Video Subtitles to search and QA over videos as well, by mapping back to source\n\n- **Guided Summarisation/Rewriting**\n  \n  - Take specific questions which the user might have about a large text dataset e.g. a novel or book and include that in your summary of the piece\n  - Pay attention to specific entities and retell the events which happen in a story with attention to that character\n  \n- **ControlNet + Stable Diffusion for Aethetic Control**\n  - Build tooling using [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/) which takes in a set of photos, finetunes a model (LoRA) on a person, detects face and moves it to a new aesthetic e.g. futuristic neon punk, grunge rock, Studio Ghibli. Can also add InstructPix2Pix to give user more control. \n  \n- **Text to Code/SQL**\n\n  - Use code understanding to convert use query to SQL or another executable programming language, including Domain Specific Languages\n  - Here is an example of the same: [qabot](github.com/hardbyte/qabot)\n  \n## Text\n\n- **Autonomous Tagging of StackOverflow Questions**\n    - Make a multi-label classification system that automatically assigns tags for questions posted on a forum such as StackOverflow or Quora.\n    - Dataset: [StackLite](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stacklite) or [10% sample](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stacksample)\n\n- **Keyword/Concept identification**\n  \n  - Identify keywords from millions of questions\n  - Dataset: [StackOverflow question samples by Facebook](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction/data)\n\n- **Topic identification**\n  - Multi-label classification of printed media articles to topics\n  - Dataset: [Greek Media monitoring multi-label classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/wise-2014/data)\n\n### Natural Language Understanding\n\n- **Sentence to Sentence semantic similarity**\n  - Can you identify question pairs that have the same intent or meaning?\n  - Dataset: [Quora question pairs](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/data) with similar questions marked\n\n- **Fight online abuse**\n  - Can you confidently and accurately tell whether a particular comment is abusive?\n  - Dataset: [Toxic comments on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)\n\n- **Open Domain question answering**\n  - Can you build a bot which answers questions according to the student's age or her curriculum?\n  - [Facebook's FAIR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DrQA) is built in a similar way for Wikipedia.\n  - Dataset: [NCERT books](https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php) for K-12/school students in India, [NarrativeQA by Google DeepMind](https://github.com/deepmind/narrativeqa) and [SQuAD by Stanford](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)\n\n- **Automatic text summarization**\n  - Can you create a summary with the major points of the original document?\n  - Abstractive (write your own summary) and Extractive (select pieces of text from original) are two popular approaches\n  - Dataset: [CNN and DailyMail News Pieces](http://cs.nyu.edu/~kcho/DMQA/) by Google DeepMind\n\n- **Copy-cat Bot**\n  - Generate plausible new text which looks like some other text\n  - Obama Speeches?
