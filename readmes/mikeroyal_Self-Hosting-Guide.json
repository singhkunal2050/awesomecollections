Software using docker can be installed using the command line or via graphical interfaces such as [Portainer](https://github.com/portainer/portainer).  Software is installed with Docker by downloading an image file containing the application, then creating a copy that sets up its own dependencies and configuration within what is called a container.  Without containers you would often need to install different versions of the same programming languages or tools to satisfy the dependencies for the software you want to use which can get complicated.\n\n <p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45159366/152699308-36691800-8078-4af3-9d5c-711da4e9b26e.png\">\n  <br />\n</p>\n\n## Tools for Self-Hosting\n[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Self-Hosting-Guide#table-of-contents)\n\n### Containers\n\n[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)\n\n**Container** is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies(including CPU, memory, file storage, and network connections) so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. \n\n  * [Application Container Security Guide | NIST (PDF)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf)\n\n**Container Image** is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application such as the code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. \n\n**Best places to get Container Images:**\n\n * [DockerHub Container Images](https://hub.docker.com/search?image_filter=official&q=&type=image)\n * [LinuxServer.io Container Images](https://fleet.linuxserver.io/)\n * [Quay Container Images](https://quay.io/search)\n\n[Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications.

For example, if you need to send a message across the internet, but you don't want anyone but the intended recipient to see what you've written.\n \n **Types of Encryption**\n \n  * **Triple DES (Triple Data Encryption Algorithm)** is a symmetric-key block cipher, which applies the DES cipher algorithm three times to each data block(contains 64 bits of data).\n  \n  * **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** is an algorithm that encrypts and decrypts data in blocks of 128 bits. It can do this using 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit keys.\n  \n  * **RSA (Rivest\u2013Shamir\u2013Adleman)** is a type of public-key cryptography used for secure data transmission of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet. \n  \n   * **Twofish**  is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key sizes up to 256 bits. It is an advanced version of Blowfish encryption.\n  \n  * **Format Preserving Encryption (FPE)** is a valid encryption algorithm to be used for compliance with NIST standards. It is mostly used in on-premise encryption and tokenization solutions.\n \n **Application Level Encryption**\n \n  * **Hashes** is a function that converts an input of letters and numbers into an encrypted output of a fixed length. For example, algorithms such as [MD5 (Message Digest 5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) or [SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_hash_algorithms).\n  \n  * **Digital Certificates** is a file that verifies the identity of a device or user and enables encrypted connections. A digital signature is a hashing approach that uses a numeric string to provide authenticity and validate identity. Digital certificates are typically issued by a **certificate authority (CA)**, which is a trusted third-party entity that issues digital certificates for use by other parties.\n\n### Backups\n\n[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)\n\n[Proxmox Backup Server](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-backup-server) is an enterprise backup solution for backing up and restoring VMs, containers, and physical hosts.

We need to configure a few options first.\n\n * Click the Configuration tab at the very top.\n\n * There are **two blocks of code here: server and peers.** The server section is the WireGuard server info, and the peers section is where you\u2019d add new devices that will connect to your VPN.\n \n **Server Configuration**\n\n   * **Host:** add the subdomain you just created. (vpn.mydomain.com)\n   * **Addresses:** If your internal network is using the 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x range, you can leave the default IP addresses WireGuard has provided. (see note above)\n   * **DNS:** Set to your router\u2019s internal IP address (**Open CMD > ipconfig /all > Under DNS servers**)\n        If you have Adguard or PiHole installed, you can use the IP address of those instead. This will allow you to block ads even when connected to the WireGuard VPN.\n\n**Peers Configuration**\n\nThis is where you\u2019ll create WireGuard configuration files for each of the devices you want to connect to WireGuard with. For this example, I\u2019m using my phone and leaving ```allowed_ips``` and ```client_allowed_ips``` as is. If you adding multiple devices, then you\u2019ll need to copy the entire block of code starting at name, give it a different name, and add the next available IP address (For example: 172.27.66.4)\n\nClick **Save** once finished.\n\nThen, go back to the Info tab and click **Start**.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45159366/190974558-dad4b4e4-295d-4074-84b8-44ca1be7078a.png\">\n  <br />\n</p>\n\n**Port Forward**\n\nThe next step is to forward port 51820 from your Home Assistant server through your router. Unfortunately, there are so many different types of routers, each with different steps to port forward. The important thing to note is that you\u2019ll be **port forwarding 51820(wireguard port)** from the internal IP of your Home Assistant instance (for example: 192.168.68.24) and choosing the **UDP protocol only**.\n \n **Download Wireguard app on mobile device**\n\nDownload the WireGuard app from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android&hl=en_US&gl=US). You will need it for the next step.\n\nIf all goes well, you can click into the new tunnel connection from within the app. If you see data flowing under the Transfer section, that means you are good to go.\n\n**Improving Security**\n\nOnce you have everything setup and working correctly, you should read through the [WireGuard Addon docs](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-wireguard/blob/main/wireguard/DOCS.md) to setup up ```allowed_ips``` and ```client_allowed_ips``` to further secure your VPN instance. There\u2019s also some other helpful options you can configure such as log level, but these are all optional.\n\n# Nextcloud\n[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Self-Hosting-Guide#table-of-contents)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45159366/150701955-f1f514a8-82e6-462f-9fc9-8926b6b7de3e.png\">\n  <br />\n  \n</p>\n\n[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) is an industry-leading, on-premises content collaboration platform for file sync & share and communication server.

Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as possible. HTTPie is designed for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with APIs & HTTP servers.\n\n[HTTPStat](https://github.com/reorx/httpstat) is a tool that visualizes curl statistics in a simple layout.\n\n[Wuzz](https://github.com/asciimoo/wuzz) is an interactive cli tool for HTTP inspection. It can be used to inspect/modify requests copied from the browser's network inspector with the \"copy as cURL\" feature.\n\n[Websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat) is a ommand-line client for WebSockets, like netcat (or curl) for ws:// with advanced socat-like functions.\n\n    \u2022 Connection: In networking, a connection refers to pieces of related information that are transferred through a network. This generally infers that a connection is built before the data transfer (by following the procedures laid out in a protocol) and then is deconstructed at the at the end of the data transfer.\n\n    \u2022 Packet: A packet is, generally speaking, the most basic unit that is transferred over a network. When communicating over a network, packets are the envelopes that carry your data (in pieces) from one end point to the other.\n\nPackets have a header portion that contains information about the packet including the source and destination, timestamps, network hops. The main portion of a packet contains the actual data being transferred. It is sometimes called the body or the payload.\n\n    \u2022 Network Interface: A network interface can refer to any kind of software interface to networking hardware. For instance, if you have two network cards in your computer, you can control and configure each network interface associated with them individually.\n\nA network interface may be associated with a physical device, or it may be a representation of a virtual interface. The \"loop-back\" device, which is a virtual interface to the local machine, is an example of this.\n\n    \u2022 LAN: LAN stands for \"local area network\". It refers to a network or a portion of a network that is not publicly accessible to the greater internet. A home or office network is an example of a LAN.\n\n    \u2022 WAN: WAN stands for \"wide area network\". It means a network that is much more extensive than a LAN. While WAN is the relevant term to use to describe large, dispersed networks in general, it is usually meant to mean the internet, as a whole.\nIf an interface is connected to the WAN, it is generally assumed that it is reachable through the internet.\n\n    \u2022 Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules and standards that basically define a language that devices can use to communicate. There are a great number of protocols in use extensively in networking, and they are often implemented in different layers.\n\nSome low level protocols are TCP, UDP, IP, and ICMP. Some familiar examples of application layer protocols, built on these lower protocols, are HTTP (for accessing web content), SSH, TLS/SSL, and FTP.\n\n    \u2022 Port: A port is an address on a single machine that can be tied to a specific piece of software. It is not a physical interface or location, but it allows your server to be able to communicate using more than one application.\n\n    \u2022 Firewall: A firewall is a program that decides whether traffic coming into a server or going out should be allowed. A firewall usually works by creating rules for which type of traffic is acceptable on which ports. Generally, firewalls block ports that are not used by a specific application on a server.\n\n    \u2022 NAT: Network address translation is a way to translate requests that are incoming into a routing server to the relevant devices or servers that it knows about in the LAN. This is usually implemented in physical LANs as a way to route requests through one IP address to the necessary backend servers.\n\n    \u2022 VPN: Virtual private network is a means of connecting separate LANs through the internet, while maintaining privacy. This is used as a means of connecting remote systems as if they were on a local network, often for security reasons.\n\n## Network Layers\n\n\tWhile networking is often discussed in terms of topology in a horizontal way, between hosts, its implementation is layered in a vertical fashion throughout a computer or network. This means is that there are multiple technologies and protocols that are built on top of each other in order for communication to function more easily. Each successive, higher layer abstracts the raw data a little bit more, and makes it simpler to use for applications and users. It also allows you to leverage lower layers in new ways without having to invest the time and energy to develop the protocols and applications that handle those types of traffic.\n\n\tAs data is sent out of one machine, it begins at the top of the stack and filters downwards. At the lowest level, actual transmission to another machine takes place. At this point, the data travels back up through the layers of the other computer. Each layer has the ability to add its own \"wrapper\" around the data that it receives from the adjacent layer, which will help the layers that come after decide what to do with the data when it is passed off.\n\n\tOne method of talking about the different layers of network communication is the OSI model. OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnect.This model defines seven separate layers. The layers in this model are:\n\n    \u2022 Application: The application layer is the layer that the users and user-applications most often interact with. Network communication is discussed in terms of availability of resources, partners to communicate with, and data synchronization.\n\n    \u2022 Presentation: The presentation layer is responsible for mapping resources and creating context. It is used to translate lower level networking data into data that applications expect to see.\n\n    \u2022 Session: The session layer is a connection handler. It creates, maintains, and destroys connections between nodes in a persistent way.\n\n    \u2022 Transport: The transport layer is responsible for handing the layers above it a reliable connection. In this context, reliable refers to the ability to verify that a piece of data was received intact at the other end of the connection. This layer can resend information that has been dropped or corrupted and can acknowledge the receipt of data to remote computers.\n\n    \u2022 Network: The network layer is used to route data between different nodes on the network. It uses addresses to be able to tell which computer to send information to. This layer can also break apart larger messages into smaller chunks to be reassembled on the opposite end.\n\n    \u2022 Data Link: This layer is implemented as a method of establishing and maintaining reliable links between different nodes or devices on a network using existing physical connections.\n\n    \u2022 Physical: The physical layer is responsible for handling the actual physical devices that are used to make a connection. This layer involves the bare software that manages physical connections as well as the hardware itself (like Ethernet).\n\nThe TCP/IP model, more commonly known as the Internet protocol suite, is another layering model that is simpler and has been widely adopted.It defines the four separate layers, some of which overlap with the OSI model:\n\n    \u2022 Application: In this model, the application layer is responsible for creating and transmitting user data between applications. The applications can be on remote systems, and should appear to operate as if locally to the end user.\nThe communication takes place between peers network.\n\n    \u2022 Transport: The transport layer is responsible for communication between processes. This level of networking utilizes ports to address different services. It can build up unreliable or reliable connections depending on the type of protocol used.\n\n    \u2022 Internet: The internet layer is used to transport data from node to node in a network. This layer is aware of the endpoints of the connections, but does not worry about the actual connection needed to get from one place to another. IP addresses are defined in this layer as a way of reaching remote systems in an addressable manner.\n\n    \u2022 Link: The link layer implements the actual topology of the local network that allows the internet layer to present an addressable interface. It establishes connections between neighboring nodes to send data.\n\n### Interfaces\n**Interfaces** are networking communication points for your computer. Each interface is associated with a physical or virtual networking device. Typically, your server will have one configurable network interface for each Ethernet or wireless internet card you have. In addition, it will define a virtual network interface called the \"loopback\" or localhost interface. This is used as an interface to connect applications and processes on a single computer to other applications and processes. You can see this referenced as the \"lo\" interface in many tools.\n\n## Network Protocols\n\nNetworking works by piggybacks on a number of different protocols on top of each other. In this way, one piece of data can be transmitted using multiple protocols encapsulated within one another.\n\n**Media Access Control(MAC)** is a communications protocol that is used to distinguish specific devices. Each device is supposed to get a unique MAC address during the manufacturing process that differentiates it from every other device on the internet. Addressing hardware by the MAC address allows you to reference a device by a unique value even when the software on top may change the name for that specific device during operation. Media access control is one of the only protocols from the link layer that you are likely to interact with on a regular basis.\n\n**The IP protocol** is one of the fundamental protocols that allow the internet to work. IP addresses are unique on each network and they allow machines to address each other across a network. It is implemented on the internet layer in the IP/TCP model. Networks can be linked together, but traffic must be routed when crossing network boundaries. This protocol assumes an unreliable network and multiple paths to the same destination that it can dynamically change between. There are a number of different implementations of the protocol. The most common implementation today is IPv4, although IPv6 is growing in popularity as an alternative due to the scarcity of IPv4 addresses available and improvements in the protocols capabilities.\n\n**ICMP: internet control message protocol** is used to send messages between devices to indicate the availability or error conditions. These packets are used in a variety of network diagnostic tools, such as ping and traceroute. Usually ICMP packets are transmitted when a packet of a different kind meets some kind of a problem. Basically, they are used as a feedback mechanism for network communications.\n\n**TCP: Transmission control protocol** is implemented in the transport layer of the IP/TCP model and is used to establish reliable connections. TCP is one of the protocols that encapsulates data into packets. It then transfers these to the remote end of the connection using the methods available on the lower layers. On the other end, it can check for errors, request certain pieces to be resent, and reassemble the information into one logical piece to send to the application layer. The protocol builds up a connection prior to data transfer using a system called a three-way handshake. This is a way for the two ends of the communication to acknowledge the request and agree upon a method of ensuring data reliability. After the data has been sent, the connection is torn down using a similar four-way handshake. TCP is the protocol of choice for many of the most popular uses for the internet, including WWW, FTP, SSH, and email. It is safe to say that the internet we know today would not be here without TCP.\n\n**UDP: User datagram protocol** is a popular companion protocol to TCP and is also implemented in the transport layer. The fundamental difference between UDP and TCP is that UDP offers unreliable data transfer. It does not verify that data has been received on the other end of the connection. This might sound like a bad thing, and for many purposes, it is. However, it is also extremely important for some functions. It\u2019s not required to wait for confirmation that the data was received and forced to resend data, UDP is much faster than TCP. It does not establish a connection with the remote host, it simply fires off the data to that host and doesn't care if it is accepted or not. Since UDP is a simple transaction, it is useful for simple communications like querying for network resources. It also doesn't maintain a state, which makes it great for transmitting data from one machine to many real-time clients. This makes it ideal for VOIP, games, and other applications that cannot afford delays.\n\n**HTTP: Hypertext transfer protocol** is a protocol defined in the application layer that forms the basis for communication on the web. HTTP defines a number of functions that tell the remote system what you are requesting. For instance, GET, POST, and DELETE all interact with the requested data in a different way.\n\n**FTP: File transfer protocol** is in the application layer and provides a way of transferring complete files from one host to another. It is inherently insecure, so it is not recommended for any externally facing network unless it is implemented as a public, download-only resource.\n\n**DNS: Domain name system** is an application layer protocol used to provide a human-friendly naming mechanism for internet resources. It is what ties a domain name to an IP address and allows you to access sites by name in your browser.\n\n**SSH: Secure shell** is an encrypted protocol implemented in the application layer that can be used to communicate with a remote server in a secure way. Many additional technologies are built around this protocol because of its end-to-end encryption and ubiquity. There are many other protocols that we haven't covered that are equally important. However, this should give you a good overview of some of the fundamental technologies that make the internet and networking possible.\n\n[REST(REpresentational State Transfer)](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest) is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.\n\n[JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io) is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
