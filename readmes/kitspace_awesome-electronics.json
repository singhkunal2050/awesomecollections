  "readme_content": "# Awesome Electronics [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)\n\n> A curated list of awesome resources for electronic engineers and hobbyists\n\nElectronic engineering (EE) is the practice of understanding, designing and building electronic circuits. It is often differentiated from electrical engineering in that it mostly deals with low power DC electronic circuits rather than high power AC systems but there is a lot of overlap between electronic and electrical engineering.\n\nExperimenting with and building electronic circuits is also a popular hobby and many professional resources are often equally applicable to hobbyists and vice versa.\n\nThis list is for websites, services, software, tools and more: everything that you think is awesome in the world of electronic engineering. If you have anything to add please follow the instructions in [contributing.md](contributing.md).\n\n## Contents\n\n<!-- toc -->\n\n- [Learning](#learning)\n  - [Technical Tutorials](#technical-tutorials)\n  - [Theory and Courses](#theory-and-courses)\n  - [University Course Archives](#university-course-archives)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Simulators](#simulators)\n  - [Analog and Mixed Signal Circuit Simulators](#analog-and-mixed-signal-circuit-simulators)\n  - [Verilog HDL Simulators](#verilog-hdl-simulators)\n- [Gerber Viewers](#gerber-viewers)\n  - [Online](#online)\n  - [Installable](#installable)\n- [Free EDA Packages](#free-eda-packages)\n- [CAD Specific](#cad-specific)\n  - [KiCad](#kicad)\n  - [Eagle](#eagle)\n- [PCB Batching Services](#pcb-batching-services)\n- [Part Search Engines](#part-search-engines)\n- [Project Sharing Platforms](#project-sharing-platforms)\n- [Inventory Management and Purchasing](#inventory-management-and-purchasing)\n- [Miscellaneous Software Projects](#miscellaneous-software-projects)\n- [Development Board Retailers](#development-board-retailers)\n- [Blogs](#blogs)\n- [Forums](#forums)\n  - [Discussion](#discussion)\n  - [Help](#help)\n- [Podcasts](#podcasts)\n- [Videos](#videos)\n- [Subscription Kit Services](#subscription-kit-services)\n- [3D Part Models](#3d-part-models)\n- [Other Lists](#other-lists)\n\n<!-- tocstop -->\n\n## Learning\n\n### Technical Tutorials\n- [\"skill\" tag on learn.sparkfun.com](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/tags/skill) - A wide variety of technical tutorials on various EE related skills.\n- [Soldering is Easy](https://mightyohm.com/blog/2011/04/soldering-is-easy-comic-book/) - Comic book that goes over the basics of soldering that has been translated into quite a few languages.\n- [Uses of Different Soldering Iron Tips](https://www.instructables.com/id/Uses-of-Different-Soldering-Iron-Tips/) - Covers what all those different soldering iron tips are good for.\n- [How to design a motherboard for your electronics project](https://www.staycaffeinated.com/2021/02/21/how-to-design-a-motherboard-for-your-project-part-1) - Introductory tutorial on Schematic & PCB design\n\n### Theory and Courses\n\n- [Lessons In Electric Circuits](https://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/) - Free high quality textbooks and worksheets with emphasis on theory, simulation, and the socratic method.\n- [Ultimate Electronics: Practical Circuit Design and Analysis](https://ultimateelectronicsbook.com/) - Free online book with interactive schematics & simulations by CircuitLab (under development).\n- [Khan Academy - Electrical Engineering](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering) - Non-profit learning platform with a full course on electrical engineering and related topics.\n- [NEETS (Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series)](https://maritime.org/doc/#neets) ([alternative link](https://github.com/thinkitdata/neets/tree/master/modules))- U.S. Navy Non-Resident Training Course Material.\n\n### University Course Archives\n\n- [Berkeley EECS](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/classes-eecs.html) - Comprehensive EE & CS course website archives.\n- [Dr. Jacob Baker](http://cmosedu.com) - Courses and tutorials, professor at The University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n- [Dr. Abraham](https://www.cerc.utexas.edu/~jaa/teaching.html), [Dr. McDermot](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~mcdermot/), and [Dr. Valvano](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/) - Courses materials, professors at UT Austin\n\n## Documentation\n- [Inkscape Electric Symbols](https://github.com/upb-lea/Inkscape_electric_Symbols) - Circuit Drawing Symbols for Inkscape\n- [Tabula](http://tabula.ondata.it/) - Extract tabular data from a pdf, very useful for extracting pin tables or part characteristics from datasheets.\n- [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/) - Extract data from plots, charts, etc., very useful for getting part performance curves from datasheets.\n- [WaveDrom](https://wavedrom.com/) - Create waveforms and timing diagrams from a JSON description file.\n\n## Simulators\n\n### Analog and Mixed Signal Circuit Simulators\n\n- [LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) - The industry standard free SPICE circuit simulator from Linear Technologies.
