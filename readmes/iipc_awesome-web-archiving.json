Web archivists typically employ Web crawlers for automated capture due to the massive scale of the Web. Ever-evolving Web standards require continuous evolution of archiving tools to keep up with the changes in Web technologies to ensure reliable and meaningful capture and replay of archived web pages.\n\n\n## Contents\n\n* [Training/Documentation](#trainingdocumentation)\n* [Resources for Web Publishers](#resources-for-web-publishers)\n* [Tools & Software](#tools--software)\n  * [Acquisition](#acquisition)\n  * [Replay](#replay)\n  * [Search & Discovery](#search--discovery)\n  * [Utilities](#utilities)\n  * [WARC I/O Libraries](#warc-io-libraries)\n  * [Analysis](#analysis)\n  * [Quality Assurance](#quality-assurance)\n  * [Curation](#curation)\n* [Community Resources](#community-resources)\n  * [Other Awesome Lists](#other-awesome-lists)\n  * [Blogs and Scholarship](#blogs-and-scholarship)\n  * [Mailing Lists](#mailing-lists)\n  * [Slack](#slack)\n  * [Twitter](#twitter)\n\n## Training/Documentation\n\n* Introductions to web archiving concepts:\n  * [What is a web archive?](https://youtu.be/ubDHY-ynWi0) - A video from [the UK Web Archive YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJukhTSw8VRj-VNTpBcqWkw)\n  * [Wikipedia's List of Web Archiving Initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Web_archiving_initiatives)\n  * [Glossary of Archive-It and Web Archiving Terms](https://support.archive-it.org/hc/en-us/articles/208111686-Glossary-of-Archive-It-and-Web-Archiving-Terms)\n  * [The Web Archiving Lifecycle Model](https://archive-it.org/blog/post/announcing-the-web-archiving-life-cycle-model/) - The Web Archiving Lifecycle Model is an attempt to incorporate the technological and programmatic arms of the web archiving into a framework that will be relevant to any organization seeking to archive content from the web.
