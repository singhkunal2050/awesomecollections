It forms one part of a project to build a fast pre-filter for packets before we conduct deeper layer-7 analysis in [Deepfence ThreatMapper](https://deepfence.io/threatmapper/).\n\n## Get in touch\n\nThank you for using FlowMeter.\n\n * [<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/documentation-read-green\">](https://docs.deepfence.io/flowmeter) Start with the documentation\n * [<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-@deepfence-blue.svg?logo=slack\">](https://join.slack.com/t/deepfence-community/shared_invite/zt-podmzle9-5X~qYx8wMaLt9bGWwkSdgQ) Got a question, need some help?
