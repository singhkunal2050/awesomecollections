You might miss higher hills though. \n- [Israeli Queue](https://rapidapi.com/blog/israeli-queues-exploring-a-bizarre-data-structure/) - A type of priority queue and a reference to the infamously unorganized queues in Israel. Here items can *cut in line* when they *have already waiting friends*.\n- [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) - Like with a stack of pancakes you can only add and remove items from the top of this data structure.\n- [Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) - A hierarchically organized data structure. From the _root_ item the other items _branch out_ into _nodes_ and _leaves_. A collection of trees is often called a *forest*.\n- [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) - In this data structure items are always added at the end and removed at the front as if the items were waiting in line.\n\n## Design Patterns and Anti Patterns\n\n- [Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) - Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.\n- [Facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) - Analogous to a facade in architecture, a facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying structure.\n- [Promise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) - A representation of a result that is available in the future, unless there are errors. Like in reality, promises are broken sometimes.\n- [Shotgun surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_surgery) - A programming antipattern where in a single change you wildly add code everywhere in your codebase.\n\n## Functions\n\n- [fold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)) - Like a blanket being folded up, this function iterates a collection and in each step combines the current item with everything that has already been folded.\n- [munch](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.19.0.0/docs/Text-ParserCombinators-ReadP.html#v:munch) - Parser function that greedily consumes an input stream until it's satisfied.\n- [trampoline](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/trampoline) - Continuously runs functions which itself return functions.
