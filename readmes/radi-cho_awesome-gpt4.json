Only query with a specific name.\nPurchase: Places an order for a compound. Give this tool only a SMILES string.\nModify compound: Proposes small modifications to a compound, as specified by SMILES.\nEmail: Format as email_address | subject | body. Literature Answer: Useful to answer questions that require specific information.\nAsk a specific question. Use the following format:\nQuestion: the input question you must answer\nThought: you should always think about what to do\nAction: the action to take, should be one of [Molecule search, Purchase, Patent Search, Modify compound, Email, Lit- erature Answer]\nAction Input: the input to the action\nObservation: the result of the action\n... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)\nThought: I now know the final answer Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question\nBegin!\nQuestion: Propose a compound with similar properties to the drug Dasatinib. Find a supplier that sells it. Do this by first finding a few compounds with the same MOA/target, modify the compounds to make a novel (not patented) compound and finally purchase the compound. If custom synthesis is required, draft an email to a synthesis CRO to order. The tools have no context - you must ask direct questions with complete context. Validate your work with tools if you are uncertain. Do not guess compound SMILES, use tools to get them.\n  ```\n  \n  Example response:\n \n  ```\nThought: I need to find a few compounds with the same MOA/target as Dasatinib\nAction: Literature Answer\nAction Input: What are a few compounds with the same MOA/target as Dasatinib?\nObservation: One compound with the same MOA/target as Dasatinib is AZD0530, which also inhibits Fyn kinase and has been shown to inhibit dengue virus (DV)\ninfection (Wispelaere0530 pages 1-1). Another compound with a similar MOA is QSYQ, a Chinese medicine that has a multi-compound-multi-target-multi-pathway mode\nof action (MOA) and is involved in the regulation of cell death, immune and inflammation response, and energy metabolism (Xiang2014 pages 5-6). However, it is\nimportant to note that while these compounds have similar MOAs, they may have different targets and pathways that they affect.\nThought: I need to modify one of these compounds to make a novel compound\nAction: Modify compound\nAction Input: AZD0530\nObservation: Given input is not valid SMILES\nThought: I need to get the SMILES string of AZD0530\nAction: Molecule search\n[Full Completion in Appendix]\n  ```\n  \n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Act as a lawyer</summary>\n  \n  Contributed by: [@radi-cho](https://github.com/radi-cho)\n  Source: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jbrowder1/status/1635720431091974157)\n  \n  > I received a spam call from `entity`.
