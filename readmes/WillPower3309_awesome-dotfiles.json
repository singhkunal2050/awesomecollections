That being said, here are the dependencies:\n\n|Dependency|Description|\n|:----------:|:-------------:|\n|`awesome`|Window manager|\n|`feh`|Fast image viewer used as wallpaper setting utility|\n|`picom-ibhagwan`|Window compositor, eliminates screen tearing and allows for cool fade effects. **ibhagwan version required for mirage theme**|\n|`rofi`|Application launcher|\n|`imagemagick`|**OPTIONAL BUT NEEDED IF USING A DIFFERENT BACKGROUND**, used in config to generate blurred wallpaper|\n\n### Optional Dependencies ###\nThese will improve the user experience but aren't required:\n**Bear in mind that most of these dependencies come preinstalled on non arch systems. I would recommend reading their descriptions below to determine which ones you need to install. Alternatively, set up my config and install the packages based on what isn't appearing in the top panel.**\n+ `i3lock`: Will be opened when the lock icon is selected in the exit window\n+ `acpi`: Battery managing cli application, used by top bar widget to determine battery status\n+ `bluez`, `bluez-utils`: Bluetooth cli application, used by top bar widget to determine if bluetooth is on\n+ `blueman`: Bluetooth managing application, spawns when the bluetooth top panel icon is clicked\n+ `scrot`: Screenshot tool, which is mapped to the Print Screen key in keys.lua. **If you want to meet this dependency, ensure that the `~/Pictures` folder exists**, otherwise the program will save your screenshots to your home directory\n+ `alsa-utils`: Provides kernel driven sound drivers, which the control of has been mapped to volume keys in keys.lua\n+ `xbacklight`: Controls display brightness, which the control of has been mapped to brightness keys in keys.lua\n\n### Fonts You Should Install ###\n+ `SF Text`: System font used by macOS, iOS, and watchOS. Used in this config as the WM font. Also used as font for firefox\n+ [`MesloLGS`](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Regular.ttf): Terminal font, customized to work flawlessly with the zsh theme used, mentioned in the [application theming](#appTheming) section of the readme.\n\n<a name=\"installation\"></a>\n## Installation ##\n1. Ensure all [dependencies](#dependencies) are met\n2. Clone this repository and place its contents into your `.config` folder\n3. edit the `awesome/rc.lua` file to select your theme, and define your desired default and startup applications, as well as network interfaces\n4. navigate to the `awesome/wallpaper` folder and place your desired wallpaper there, ensuring that it is named either `wallpaper.jpg` if using the pastel theme, or `mirage.png` if using the mirage theme. Remember to delete the `blurredWallpaper` file in order to make the blurring script recognize a new wallpaper has been added and needs to be blurred \n5. optional: edit the `keys.lua` file to change / add keybinds\n\n<a name=\"folderStructure\"></a>\n## Awesome Folder File Structure ##\nIn order to avoid a poorly organized `rc.lua` spanning thousands of lines, it has been split into multiple files / folders. I have taken extra care to create a logical directory structure that will hopefully allow those new to awesomewm to have an easy time navigating it.\n+ `rc.lua`: The main script that runs when awesome starts. Defines theme and default applications, and selects them\n+ `keys.lua`: Contains keybinds\n+ `rules.lua`: Contains window rules\n+ `pastel.lua`: Initializes the pastel theme (spawns all of the pastel theme components)\n+ `mirage.lua`: Initializes the mirage theme (spawns all of the mirage theme components)\n+ `themes`: Contains files with theme variables (ie colors, sizing, font, etc)\n+ `icons`: stores icons used in WM\n+ `components`: Folder that contains all of the components of the WM, such as panels, volume and brightness sliders, notification pop-ups, etc\n+ `configuration`: Contains theme-based config files for applications (ie rofi, picom, etc)\n+ `widgets`: Stores widgets used in the functionality of the components\n+ `wallpaper`: Where wallpaper and its blurred varient is generated / stored\n\n### Other cool applications you should install ###\n+ `redshift`: Changes screen warmth based on the time of day\n+ `neofetch`: Displays system information in the terminal\n+ `cmatrix`: Terminal base matrix text effect\n\n<a name=\"appTheming\"></a>\n## Application Theming ##\n### Firefox ###\n**Pastel**\n1.

Fini! Reopen the terminal to view the fruit of your labor\n\n<a name=\"keybinds\"></a>\n## Keybinds ##\n**Note that the modkey is set to be the windows / command key. If you would like to use a different modkey check out the `keys.lua` file.**\nIf you are new to awesomewm, note that tag refers to workspace, and client refers to window. Shown below are the **main** keybinds that most users will care about.\n\n### Keyboard ###\n+ `mod + enter`: Spawn terminal\n+ `mod + d`: Spawn rofi (an application menu)\n+ `mod + f`: Make client fullscreen\n+ `mod + m`: Maximize client\n+ `mod + n`: Minimize client\n+ `mod + shift + n`: Unminimize client\n+ `mod + [1-9]`: Switch to tag [1-9]\n+ `mod + shift + [1-9]`: Move client to tag [1-9]\n+ `mod + space`: Change the tag layout, alternating between tiled, floating, and maximized\n+ `mod + [up / down / left / right / h / j / k / l]`: Change client by direction\n+ `mod + Shift + [up / down / left / right / h / j / k / l]`: Move client by direction\n+ `mod + Control + [up / down / left / right / h / j / k / l]`: Resize client by direction\n+ `mod + Escape`: Show exit screen\n\n### Mouse ###\n+ `mod + drag with left click`: Move client\n+ `mod + drag with right click`: Resize client\n\n<a name=\"notes\"></a>\n## Notes ##\n+ [Awesome API Documentation](https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/index.html)\n+ If you encounter any problems please open an issue in this repo and I will gladly investigate it\n+ If you would like to change the wallpaper, ensure that the wallpaper is named \"wallpaper\" and is located in the `~/.config/awesome` folder. Also ensure that you delete the blurred wallpaper file in order for the blurring script to recognize it needs to generate a new blurred wallpaper\n"
