It becomes increasingly more interesting as you explore its capabilities for responsive animation and performance boons. When you animate SVG, you must be aware of normal image traits like composition, color, implementation, and optimization. But when you animate, it increases the complexity of each of these factors exponentially.\n\n### [Creating Web Animations: Bringing Your UIs to Life](https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Web-Animations-Bringing-Your/dp/1491957514/)\n\n<img src=\"data/covers/NK9rDgAAQBAJ.jpg\" width=\"200\"/>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks to faster browsers, better web standards support, and more powerful devices, the web now defines the next generation of user interfaces that are fun, practical, fluid, and memorable.
