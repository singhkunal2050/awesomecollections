The premise of Domain-Driven Design is the following:\n\n- placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic\n- basing complex designs on a model of the domain\n- initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems\n\nThe term was coined by Eric Evans in his book of the same title.\n\n**[Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)](http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/2010/02/16/cqrs-task-based-uis-event-sourcing-agh/)** is simply the creation of two objects where there was previously only one. The separation occurs based upon whether the methods are a command or a query (the same definition that is used by Meyer in Command and Query Separation, a command is any method that mutates state and a query is any method that returns a value).\n\n**[Event Sourcing](http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)** the fundamental idea of Event Sourcing is that of ensuring every change to the state of an application is captured in an event object, and that these event objects are themselves stored in the sequence they were applied for the same lifetime as the application state itself.\n\n**[Event Storming](https://ziobrando.blogspot.com/2013/11/introducing-event-storming.html)** is a workshop format for quickly exploring complex business domains.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [Awesome Domain-Driven Design](https://github.com/heynickc/awesome-ddd/)\n\t- [Contents](#contents)\n\t- [Books](#books)\n\t- [Free eBooks](#free-ebooks)\n\t- [Training Courses](#training-courses)\n\t- [Video Collections](#video-collections)\n\t- [Community Resources](#community-resources)\n\t- [Blogs](#blogs)\n\t- [Sample Projects](#sample-projects)\n\t\t- [GO](#go)\n\t\t- [.NET (C#/F#)](#net-cf)\n\t\t- [Haskell](#haskell)\n\t\t- [Idris](#idris)\n\t\t- [JavaScript / TypeScript](#javascript--typescript)\n\t\t- [JVM languages](#jvm-languages)\n\t\t- [PHP](#php)\n\t- [Libraries and Frameworks](#libraries-and-frameworks)\n\t\t- [GO](#go-1)\n\t\t- [.NET](#net)\n\t\t- [Databases](#databases)\n\t\t- [Elixir](#elixir)\n\t\t- [JavaScript / TypeScript](#javascript--typescript-1)\n\t\t- [JVM](#jvm)\n\t\t- [PHP](#php-1)\n\t\t- [Python](#python)\n\t\t- [Ruby](#ruby)\n\t- [Podcasts and Interviews](#podcasts-and-interviews)\n\t- [Conferences](#conferences)\n\t- [User Groups](#user-groups)\n\t- [Tools](#tools)\n\t- [License](#license)\n\n## Books\n\n- [Applying Domain Driven Design with CQRS and Event Sourcing](https://buildplease.com/pages/now-what/) - A walkthrough of using EventStorming and other modeling techniques to build a CQRS and Event Sourcing-based prototype for a fictional business domain.\n- [Architecture Modernization](https://www.manning.com/books/architecture-modernization) - Concrete tools, techniques, and processes to align software architecture with your business domains, organizational design, team topologies, and corporate strategy.\n- [Collaborative Software Design](https://www.manning.com/books/collaborative-software-design) - A practical guide for effectively involving all stakeholders in the design of software.A practical guide for effectively involving all stakeholders in the design of software.\n- [CQRS](https://leanpub.com/cqrs) - Notes by Mark Nijhof from his experiences learning DDD and CQRS from Greg Young.
