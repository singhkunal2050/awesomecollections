Best read it first as many apps below I use on mac too and describe in more detail there.\n\nI only use 2 active spaces on my phone without any folders to minimize hand movement. Everything is optimized for reachability and partly aesthetics. I nearly always use dark mode as I prefer it unless I am outside and it's hard to read the text.\n\niOS for me is a consumption and communication device primarily so I try to offload heavy busy work to macOS.\n\nI minimize push notifications I actually receive to only messaging apps. Mostly just [Telegram](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/telegram). Everything else I have to go inside the apps to check what's new so as to not distract me from day to day life. I also keep it on Do Not Disturb nearly always too. Especially when I work on my mac and keep the phone on the side so as to not duplicate notifications.\n\n### Productivity\n\n- [Fantastical](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/fantastical) use to manage my calendar and events. I like their widget to show my current schedule of the day.\n- [2Do](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/2do) for personal tasks. Want to move away from it as the current sync takes too long sadly. But the mac 2Do app is unmatched currently.\n- [1Password](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/1password) use it whenver I need to find some specific secret file like Passport photo or details.\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/mobile) don't use often but is nice when I need to reply to an urgent issue.\n- [Wipr](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wipr/id1030595027) - Safari ad blocker. Works well.\n- [Safari](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/web/browsers/safari) absolutely love it for reading and opening pages. Works fast. I like keeping [top used sites in bookmarks bar](https://i.imgur.com/uDjnhwX.jpg) so I can open them fast.\n\n### Social\n\n- [Telegram](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/telegram) use it chat and read groups. Want to start using it more heavily by creating specialized bots.\n- [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io/) love the client and its custom gestures (like swiping back & forth by initiating the swipe in the middle of the screen and not on the side).\n- [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com) use it to check on mail. I don't have notifications set for email.\n- [Slack](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/slack) & [Discord](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/discord) to check up on communities I am in.\n\n### Photos\n\n- [Photos](http://www.apple.com/lae/ios/photos/) does good job of managing and searching for photos I need. I have few albums I made for myself to make finding things easier too. Love its Memories feature and use the Photos Widget to remind myself of the past photos I took or saved.\n- [VSCO](https://www.vsco.co/) & [Darkroom](https://darkroom.co) for photo editing. Don't pay for VSCO as it's quite expensive but they both do a good job at editing photos.\n- [Slidebox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slidebox-photo-manager/id984305203?mt=8) use it to quickly clean up photos, especially duplicates or bad takes.\n- [Instagram](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/social-networks/instagram) not a fan of how many ads IG pushes to the feeds/stories but I do love content of many accounts there so I still use it. Share some [photos and stories of my life](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/) in there.\n\n### Learn\n\n- [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) use it to listen to [podcasts I like](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/podcasts). I love its [smart speed](https://medium.com/@eped/overcasts-smart-speed-vs-real-time-a759549ab48b#.f05tiojfo) feature to cut out on silent pauses.\n- [Audible](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audible-audio-books-podcasts/id379693831?mt=8) listen to audio books there.\n- [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) I do nearly all the reading of [RSS](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/web/rss) on the mac.\n- [Books](https://www.apple.com/ibooks/) use it to read some books. It recently added a nice [digital narration](https://authors.apple.com/support/4519-digital-narration-audiobooks).\n- [V for Wiki](http://v-for-wiki.com) love exploring wikipedia when I am bored. This is nice app for doing this. Typography in it is great.\n\n### Music\n\n- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) use it to stream all [my music](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/music).\n\n### Travel\n\n- [Google Maps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps-transit-food/id585027354?mt=8) use it as my main navigation app and a travel guide. Collect [lists of places I want to visit and places I loved seeing](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/travel/visited).\n\n### Automation\n\n- [Scriptable](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?mt=8) don't use it much but want to.\n\n## Widgets\n\nI use 2 widgets in lock screen.\n\n- Create new task with [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)\n- Chat with [ChatGPT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatgpt/id6448311069)\n\nI keep common shortcut actions as widgets on the side (just need to scroll left to access):\n\n<a align=\"center\" href=\"https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios\">\n    <img width=\"250\" helgth=\"400\" src=\"https://images.nikiv.dev/my-ios-shortcuts.png\"></a>\n\n## Shortcuts\n\nI color all [shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) I use with gray color for consistency.\n\n- [Translate](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fdaecce3abdd424c97cfb2b62cad8e4d) - Open Google Translate.\n- [Event](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4b73f41a0f97415ba13ca93c47e54b2b) - Create new event with Fantastical.\n- [Next](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/495dcc6aa4ec4d87a103a6b43ef59bd8) - Show directions to next event(s).\n- [Ask](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5a5ce4ca0b544dbc8b75b9b62e3769ba) - Ask Google Assistant.\n- [Places](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/aabd468fe26b48ffa47d6f803aa5b35e) - Find (Work/Parks/Libraries/Groceries/Restaurants/Attractions/Cafes/Home) in Google Maps.\n- [2Do](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/88d8f30c7ae9437a8ad292793c61b57e) - Make new 2Do task.\n- [Contacts](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c0c71e89165a4c1e8fe4efa8900412b4) - Type into [Cardhop](https://flexibits.com/cardhop).\n- [Tweet](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/af9b8f223ec440daa04da332581f8415) - Start typing new tweet.\n- [Focus](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/bbfec2eaa7a2469787068e02550a9eff) - Play rain sound using [Dark Noise](https://darknoise.app).\n- [Podcast](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/54d1a3caa4d547a5805f310f0fbcb102) - Play most recently played or first unplayed [podcast episode](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/podcasts/).\n- [HN](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a21eba16d13e45a6bdf8805d0d3e3222) - Opens [hckrnews](http://hckrnews.com) in Safari in new tab.\n- [Photo](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a209e209f1864eed89377e1f70a47587) - Open Camera app to take photo/video.\n- [Drive](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5b68f7221cde454b81ca99c3c743f636) - Search Google Drive.\n- [Sort](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fb0625ff34874e7aa0f40a489a3a0014) - Open [Slidebox](http://slidebox.co).\n- [Notes](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e9b73752268c453bb4e044a4419e1a67) - Opens Ulysses Favorite notes.\n- Saved - Open Telegram Saved Messages.

I use the same prototyping idea with [KM macros](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros).\n\n<a align=\"center\" href=\"https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios\">\n    <img width=\"250\" heigth=\"400\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bbohfKP.png\"></a>\n\n## Control Center\n\nHere is how my control center looks:\n\n<a align=\"center\" href=\"https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios\">\n    <img width=\"250\" heigth=\"400\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JFxssYt.jpg\"></a>\n\n## Third page for other + testing apps\n\nI only use the 2 pages of apps and that's often enough. The third page is mostly 'other' apps I rarely need plus a way to test out new apps or develop apps of my own.\n\n<a align=\"center\" href=\"https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios\">\n    <img width=\"250\" heigth=\"400\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios/main/4.jpeg\"></a>\n\n## WatchOS\n\nI actually stopped wearing a watch. But when I did I mostly used it to track my health and fitness and view useful information at a glance like current time and events.\n\n<a align=\"center\" href=\"https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios\">\n    <img width=\"250\" heigth=\"400\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qzFn7Ot.jpg\"></a>\n\nI used only one Infograph Modular watch face. It shows the current time and day, the weather and my current or future calendar events (with [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)). It also lets me quickly start cardio workout (running/biking) or bodyweight workout (with [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com)). I can also start a timer or see the time of a timer if one is already running.\n\n## iPad\n\nI mostly use my iPad for drawing with [Procreate](https://procreate.art) or noting/sketching in [Notes](https://www.icloud.com/notes)/[Muse](https://museapp.com/) with Apple Pencil. I also sometimes use it as second screen with [Sidecar](https://support.apple.com/en-me/HT210380).\n\n<a align=\"center\" href=\"https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios\">\n    <img width=\"450\" heigth=\"450\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios/main/ipad.png\"></a>\n\n<a align=\"center\" href=\"https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios\">\n    <img width=\"450\" heigth=\"450\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios/main/ipad2.png\"></a>\n\n## Games\n\nI prefer using PS5 for playing [games](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/games) as the games there are much better. Some games I rarely play on iPad are:\n\n- [Lichess](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lichess-online-chess/id968371784)\n- [Wild Rift](https://apps.apple.com/app/league-of-legends-wild-rift/id1480616990)\n\n## [My macOS](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac)\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac/main/dark.png\">\n</a>\n\nIf you found this interesting, I also have a [similar repository](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac) going over what applications I use on macOS.\n\n## Related\n\n- [Awesome iOS](https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios)\n- [Sharecuts](https://sharecuts.app/) - Public repository of shortcuts for the Shortcuts app.\n- [Shortcuts Gallery](https://shortcutsgallery.com/)\n\n## Contribute\n\n[Suggestions](../../issues/) are welcome. \u2728\n\n[Open new issue](../../issues/new/choose) or [start discussion](../../discussions).\n\nJoin [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TVafwaD23d) for more indepth discussions on this repo and [others](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev#src).\n\n### \u2665\ufe0f\n\n[Support on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev) or look into [other projects](https://nikiv.dev/projects).\n\n[![MIT](http://bit.ly/mitbadge)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) [![Twitter](http://bit.ly/nikitatweet)](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev)\n"
