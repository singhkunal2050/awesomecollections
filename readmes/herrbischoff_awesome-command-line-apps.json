  "readme_content": "# Awesome macOS Command Line / Awesome Command-Line Apps\n\nDue to personal changes, GitHub changes, a desire of not wanting to continue to \ndeal with mostly very low-effort contributions, entitled behavior and low \nquality, I've permanently moved these projects to my personal Git instance, \nwhere they will live from now on.\n\n<https://git.herrbischoff.com/awesome-macos-command-line/about/>  \n<https://git.herrbischoff.com/awesome-command-line-apps/about/>\n\nThis is not least because of a substantially lacking readiness to donate even a \nsingle dollar \u2014 despite hundreds of daily visitors and almost 30k combined \nstars. Instead, these repositories are being linked to from large corporate \nintranets as a free source of knowledge, at times even from inside Apple. There \nhave been two notable exceptions over the last six years: one donation to the \nNGO of a dear friend and a single GitHub sponsor for a couple of months. 100% \nwere forwarded to the NGO as well. My thanks go out to you, you know who you \nare.\n\nAvailable under the same license it has always been, you can still contribute \nand are encouraged to do so by sending a `git am` style patch via email. This \nis intentional to keep the lazy ones out and I much prefer working mostly in \nthe shell. Please invest the five minutes to figure out how to if you think \nyour contribution matters. You can clone this repository, you can find out my \nemail address.\n\nBonus link: <https://git-send-email.io>\n"
