Here are some arguments:\n\n- [Do engineering managers need to be technical?](https://increment.com/teams/do-engineering-managers-need-to-be-technical/) - Yes. \u201cLooking forward to the next 30 years of management trends, only a few things seem certain: Managers should be technical, and the definition of technical will continue to change.\u201d\n\n- [If Your Boss Could Do Your Job, You're More Likely to Be Happy at Work](https://hbr.org/2016/12/if-your-boss-could-do-your-job-youre-more-likely-to-be-happy-at-work) - \u201cAlthough we found that many factors can matter for happiness at work \u2013 type of occupation, level of education, tenure, and industry are also significant, for instance \u2013 they don't even come close to mattering as much as the boss' technical competence.\u201d\n\n- \u201cThe best managers I met tended to be those that if the circumstance required it, could do the job of those two levels below.\u201d ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23891984)) - Another way of putting it: managers needs domain knowledge and to know the work their reports do.\n\n- \u201cOver the years we have developed the policy that it is important for the supervisor to thoroughly know and understand the work of his group.\u201d ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20683609)) - This quote is [from David Packard](https://www.amazon.com/HP-Way-Hewlett-Built-Company/dp/0887307477?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1686404404&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=kevideld-20&linkId=e6069674f9b0b4ef884b0f8f70eb8f94&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) (HP co-founder), decades before current [management fad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_fad).\n\n### Systems Complexity\n\nWhatever the technical stack, we are building systems first, and have to manage its complexity.\n\n- [Second-system effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect) - \u201cTendency of small, elegant, and successful systems, to be succeeded by over-engineered, bloated systems\u201d.\n\n- [Living with Complexity, by Donald A. Norman](https://www.amazon.com/Living-Complexity-Donald-Norman-2010/dp/B00DEKM5GK?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1686404524&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=kevideld-20&linkId=497ae387bbd398624d897bdfbf90f7b6&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) - In which we learn that, based on [Tesler's law of the conservation of complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_conservation_of_complexity), \u201cthe total complexity of a system is a constant: as you make the person's interaction simpler, the hidden complexity behind the scenes increases. Make one part of the system simpler, said Tesler, and the rest of the system gets more complex.\u201d\n\n- [The Efficiency-Destroying Magic of Tidying Up](https://flocrivello.com/the-efficiency-destroying-magic-of-tidying-up/) - \u201cEfficiency tends to look messy, and good looks tend to be inefficient.\u201d A reminder that sometimes we should just accept [the messiness of the world](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood).\n\n- [I try to optimize my code around reducing state, coupling, complexity and code, in that order](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11042400) - An engineer's perspective on which priorities should be addressed first to increase robustness of systems.\n\n- [SpaceX's 5-Step design and manufacturing process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t705r8ICkRw&t=13m30s) - \u201c1. Make requirement less dumb; 2. Try to delete parts; 3. Simplify or optimize; 4. Accelerate cycle time; 5. Automate\u201d. See [full transcript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28517976).\n\n### Technology\n\n- [Choose Boring Technology](http://boringtechnology.club) - \u201cBoring, in the sense that it's well understood.\u201d\n\n- [Choose Well-known Technology](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23445535) - A rephrasing of the above advice. \u201cChoose the technology: 1. You know in and out, and are immediately productive with; 2. Which is sure to be around in 5-7 years, preferably 10-15; 3. For which you are comfortable hiring the next 15 engineers.\u201d\n\n- [Industry Data Models](http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/) - A huge list of database templates to represent any business process.\n\n- [I thought that using loops was cheating\u2026](https://www.facebook.com/spliceofficial/photos/a.555206991212765/679408552125941/?type=1&theater) - How much is too much? Libraries, whether software or audio loops, are tools. A typical case of [NIH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) transposed to music production.\n\n- \u201cLots of people make the mistake of thinking there's only two vectors you can go to improve performance, high or wide. High - throw hardware at the problem, on a single machine. Wide - add more machines. [There's a third direction you can go, I call it *going deep*.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8902739)\u201d\n\n- [You need to be this tall to use (micro) services](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12509533) - Do not chase the hype. Yet. Micro-services only brings value past a certain infrastructure and organization size. This is a list of stuff you should focus on before bringing micro-services to the mix.\n\n- [LEGO blocks and organ transplants](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/02/03/lego-blocks-and-organ-transplants/) - \u201cPeople have been comparing software components to LEGO blocks for a couple decades. (\u2026) Integrating two software systems is usually more like performing a heart transplant than snapping together LEGO blocks.\u201d\n\n- \u201cSoftware development is more akin to the product design and development phase of industrial production than to the manufacturing.\u201d ([source](https://accu.org/bookreviews/1998/kloss_1668/)) - This quote is from a review of [*Superdistribution - Objects as Property on the Electronic Frontier*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201502089?&linkCode=ll1&tag=kevideld-20&linkId=dc65849a678d52afa9f3685159673d6e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), in which the creator of Objective-C was advocating in the 90's for a new economic framework that rewards creation of components in proportion to their use. But software production is not like manufacturing of widgets in a factory. [A (software) object is not an (hardware) widget](https://twitter.com/kdeldycke/status/1697974273623675254).\n\n### Engineering Practices\n\n- [Software Engineering's Greatest Hits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrVtA-ue-x0) - When scientific method meet the practice of software development. My takeaways: the best metric is less lines of code, there is no 10x developers, too much unused configuration options, pair programing is for transfer of domain-specific knowledge and hackathon don't produce long term projects.\n\n- [Code reviews at Google](https://github.com/google/eng-practices/blob/master/review/reviewer/speed.md#why-should-code-reviews-be-fast-why) - \u201cWhy Should Code Reviews Be Fast? (\u2026) To optimize for the speed at which a team of developers can produce a product together, as opposed to optimizing for the speed at which an individual developer can write code.\u201d\n\n- [Google Engineering Practices](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/) - Explains how to perform code reviews and how to submit them.\n\n- [Embedded Rules of Thumb](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2018/04/26/embedded-rules-of-thumb/) - Guidelines and heuristics to provide a reasonable approximation of the truth while developing embedded devices. Most also applies to software projects in general.\n\n- [How to Misuse Code Coverage](https://web.archive.org/web/20180508120159/http://www.testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Marick_coverage.pdf) - \u201cIf a part of your test suite is weak in a way that coverage can detect, it's likely also weak in a way coverage can't detect.\u201d I.e. the great benefit of a coverage report is that it tells you what you forgot to think about when you wrote the test suite itself ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28678098)).\n\n### Technical Debt\n\n- [Tech Due Diligence Calculator](https://decodingvc.gitbooks.io/p9-startup-tech-due-diligence-calculator/content/) - A list of questions by topic to help understand how you are building your tech and engineering team, trying to highlight red flags.\n\n- [Technical Debt Is Like Tetris](https://medium.com/s/story/technical-debt-is-like-tetris-168f64d8b700) - Another way to explain technical debt: \u201cScenarios like these create technical debt within the product code. A buried gap in Tetris represents technical debt. (\u2026) Paying down technical debt keeps you competitive. It keeps you in the game.\u201d\n\n- [Technical debt as a lack of understanding](https://daverupert.com/2020/11/technical-debt-as-a-lack-of-understanding/) - \u201cThe problem lies in \"never reorganizing \\[the code\\] to reflect your understanding.\" (\u2026) Organizationally, you pay in velocity and turnover; talented people are going to leave after a few rounds of bullshit.\u201d\n\n- [The Framing of the Developer](https://www.amazingcto.com/develop-for-impact-not-for-backlog/) - Default framing is around the backlog, which leads to an asymmetry in which failure is blamed on lacks of developer performance, and success is celebrated as the full realization of the PM's vision. But \u201ctechnology is the bank that gave credit\u201d, and technical debt should be called product debt \u201cbecause product took the credit to get a feature faster and must pay back by investing the time to clean up.\u201d The alternative? \u201cCompanies today need a frame of impact. In this world-view success is defined by impact.\u201d\n\n- [Goodbye, Clean Code](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/) - \u201cMy boss invited me for a one-on-one chat where they politely asked me to revert my change. I was aghast. The old code was a mess, and mine was clean! (\u2026) I see now that my 'refactoring' was a disaster in two ways: I didn't talk to the person who wrote it; My code traded the ability to change requirements for reduced duplication\u201d.\n\n## Remote Work\n\n- [The Surprising Traits of Good Remote Leaders](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200827-why-in-person-leaders-may-not-be-the-best-virtual-ones) - \u201cthe confidence, intelligence and extroversion that have long propelled ambitious workers into the executive suite are not enough online because they simply don't translate into virtual leadership. (\u2026) Instead, workers who are organized, dependable and productive take the reins of virtual teams.\u201d As the [source paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-020-09698-0) say it best: \u201cvirtually, the emphasis shifts from saying to doing.\u201d\n\n- [Things to look for when hiring remote workers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17022563) - \u201c1. You have to adhere to employment laws within the country you're hiring from; 2. To employ someone full time, many countries require you to have a legally entity within that country; 3. Prioritize countries where we have the most interest; 4. Keep a healthy timezone overlap in each of our teams.\u201d\n\n- [Managing Remote Teams - A Crash Course](http://klinger.io/post/180989912140/managing-remote-teams-a-crash-course) - Compilation of easy rules and processes to bootstrap a remote team.\n\n- [GitLab's Guide to All-Remote](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/) - \u201cGitLab is the world's largest all-remote company\u201d.
