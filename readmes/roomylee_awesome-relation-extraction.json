In terms of the latter, authors propose *frames*, where every frame yelds of: (1) *trigger* (span) and (2) *n*-slots, where every slot\n\tmay refer to *frame* or *span*. \n\tThe framework poses no theoretical restrictions to the window from which frames are extracted.\n\tThus, this concept may cover sentence-level, document-level and multi-document RE tasks.\n    \n    \n\n[Back to Top](#contents)\n\n\n## License\n[![license](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/60561947585c982aee67ed3e3b25388184cc0aa3/687474703a2f2f6d6972726f72732e6372656174697665636f6d6d6f6e732e6f72672f70726573736b69742f627574746f6e732f38387833312f7376672f63632d7a65726f2e737667)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n\nTo the extent possible under law, [Joohong Lee](https://roomylee.github.io/) has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this work.\n"
