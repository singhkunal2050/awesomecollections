By default you will have NODE_ENV defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with REACT_APP_. These environment variables will be defined for you on process.env. For example, having an environment variable named REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE will be exposed in your JS as process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE, in addition to process.env.NODE_ENV\n\n- [Adding Development Environment Variables In `.env`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env)\n\n> To define permanent environment variables, create a file called .env in the root of your project\n\n### How to Use Multiple Env Configs\n\nRight now it is possible installing [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) and updating npm scripts:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"node -r dotenv/config ./node_modules/.bin/react-scripts start dotenv_config_path=development.env\",\n  \"build\": \"node -r dotenv/config ./node_modules/.bin/react-scripts build dotenv_config_path=production.env\"\n}\n```\n\nThere is the Pull Request [#1344](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1344) that implements [Support different env configs](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1343):\n\nRead different `.env` configs according to current command (start / test / build).\n\nWhat .env* files are used?\n\n* `.env` - Default\n* `.env.development`, `.env.test`, `.env.production` - Environment-specific settings.\n* `.env.local` - Local overrides. This file is loaded for all environments except test.\n* `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`, `.env.production.local` - Local overrides of environment-specific settings.\n\nFiles priority (file is skipped if does not exist):\n\n* npm test - `.env.test.local`, `env.test`, `.env.local`, `.env`\n* npm run build - `.env.production.local`, `env.production`, `.env.local`, `.env`\n* npm start - `.env.development.local`, `env.development`, `.env.local`, `.env`\n\nPriority from left to right.\n\nBy default (if custom config does not exist) read env variables from .env file.\n\n### Advanced Configuration \n\n<img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/59e1be59d191ad29983a91b039f0e9089918dfb4/68747470733a2f2f7075752e73682f745866456c2f336361346536636264652e706e67\" alt=\"Create React App Advanced Configuration\"/>\n\nThese are environment variables. Use [cross-env](https://github.com/kentcdodds/cross-env) to set environment variables across platforms or *.env* config.\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"cross-env BROWSER=firefox react-scripts start\"\n}\n```\n\nIf you use `.env` config - just add `BROWSER` variable:\n\n```\nBROWSER=none\n```\n\n### Lazy Loading\n\nOriginal issue - [Lazy load (chunking) feature? #925](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/925)\n\n> You can use require.ensure() because we use webpack under the hood.\nWhen we switch to webpack 2, you can use System.import instead.\n\n### How to Setup Root Dir for Require\n\nWhat is the alternative for `webpack module.resolveDirectory`?\n\nOfficial solution: create `node_modules` at `src` directory - [src/node_modules as official solution for absolute imports #1065](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1065)\n\nAnother way - use `NODE_PATH` env variable. It is a directory name to be resolved to the current directory as well as its ancestors, and searched for modules. It is [resolve.modules](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-modules) for webpack. More details at node official documentation [\"Loading from the global folders\"](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_the_global_folders).\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"cross-env NODE_PATH=src/scripts react-scripts start\"\n}\n```\n\nIf you use `.env` config - just add `NODE_PATH` variable:\n\n```\nNODE_PATH=src/scripts\n```\n\n## HMR (Hot Module Replacement)\n\nBy default HMR works only for CSS modules. If you want to use for components add these lines to *index.js*:\n\n> NOTE: This will work but not preserve the components state, but redux / mobx / whatever state managers will be preserved\n\n```js\n// App - root component\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst render = Root => {\n  ReactDOM.render(<Root />,\n    document.getElementById('root')\n  );\n}\n\nrender(App);\n\nif (module.hot) {\n  module.hot.accept('./App', () => {\n    var NextApp = require('./App').default;\n    render(NextApp);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### How to Use Custom Babel Presets\n\nCreate React App [doesn\u2019t support decorator syntax](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#can-i-use-decorators) at the moment.\n\nThere are PR [Adding support for custom babel configuration #1357](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1357). If PR is merged then these features will be available:\n\n- [Decorators](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-decorators )\n- Features from [stage-0 preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-0/)\n- Any new babel features and presets\n\nPR is closed but\n\n- As soon as feature becomes candidate - CRA will support it. Here is [tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/818626114037968899) about decorators.\n- Features from stages 0 - 2 are not support because a lot of them hasn't been updated in a long time and doesn't appear to progress.\n\n[@dan_abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) wrote:\n\n> - [I'm happy to add decorators after they've moved to stage 3](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/818626114037968899)\n\n> - [Bind proposal hasn't been updated in a long time and doesn't appear to progress. Might not make it at all either.](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/818626659926609920)\n\n> - [Imagine the horror of building / maintaining an app that relies on dead syntax features five years from now.](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/818627079306694658)\n\n\nSo we do not recommend to use babel presets besides the [babel-preset-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-react-app) that is already configured at Create React App.\n\n### How to Change Webpack Entry Point and Output Dir?\n\nThere is the issue - [Customize build folder #1354](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1354).\nThis is feature is very useful along with entry point customizing and I have left  [comment](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1354#issuecomment-275647959) about this.\n\nBut according to this Pull Request [Fix- react-scripts build doesn't allow for specified path #1362](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1362#issuecomment-271284738) we should not expect such customizations in near future.\n\n> won\u2019t be introducing more configuration on a case-by-case basis. We might add support for a configuration file at some point, but not now.\n\nThere are some hacks how to change webpack config but note that it is officially unsupported and can break in any version.\n\n### Watching Build Mode on Create React App\n\nExample is [here](https://gist.github.com/int128/e0cdec598c5b3db728ff35758abdbafd)\n\n### How to Change Webpack Config?\n### How to Add Custom Webpack Plugins?\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"build:custom\": \"node scripts/webpack\"\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// scripts/webpack.js\nconst webpack = require('react-scripts/node_modules/webpack');\nconst craWebpackConfig = require('react-scripts/config/webpack.config.prod');\nconst OfflinePlugin = require('offline-plugin');\n\nconst config = {\n  ...craWebpackConfig,\n  plugins: [\n     ...craWebpackConfig.plugins,\n     new OfflinePlugin()\n  ]\n};\n\nwebpack(config).run(function(err, stats) {\n  if (err !== null) {\n    console.log('done');\n  } else {\n    console.log(err);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**Note: this is officially unsupported and can break in any version.**\n\nAlso note that this is just webpack config extending, not `react-scripts build`. There is not beautiful console logs, comparison of the build size and other `react-scitpts build` command features.\n\nSuch approach (workaround) also helps to resolve problems when need to build/pubish a single component. There is the related issue - [How to publish components without ejecting #796](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/796). Just override webpack entry point and output.\n\nAlways remember that using not usual loaders (like yaml, markdown, dsv loaders etc.), additional plugins and features from drafts and proposals makes your application more complex, maybe with dead syntax features and it is become impossible to migrate from current webpack configuration.\n"
