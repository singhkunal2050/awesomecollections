This repository covers only cyber security in the cloud and the DevSecOps scope. \n\n# Table of Contents\n\n- [Definition](#what-is-devsecops)\n- [Tooling](#tooling)\n- [Precommit and threat modeling](#pre-commit-time-tools)\n- [SAST](#sast)\n- [DAST](#dast)\n- [Orchestration](#orchestration)\n- [Supply chain and dependencies](#oss-and-dependency-management)\n- [Infrastructure as code](#infrastructure-as-code-security)\n- [Containers security](#containers)\n- [Kubernetes](#kubernetes) \n- [Cloud](#multi-cloud)\n- [Chaos engineering](#chaos-engineering)\n- [Policy as code](#policy-as-code)\n- [Methodologies](#methodologies-whitepapers-and-architecture)\n- [Other](#other)\n- [License](#license) \n\n# What is DevSecOps \nDevSecOps focuses on security automation, testing and enforcement during DevOps - Release - SDLC cycles. The whole meaning behind this methodology is connecting together Development, Security and Operations. DevSecOps is methodology providing different methods, techniques and processes backed mainly with tooling focusing on developer / security experience. \n\nDevSecOps takes care that security is part of every stage of DevOps loop - Plan, Code, Build, Test, Release, Deploy, Operate, Monitor. \n\nVarious definitions: \n* https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops\n* https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/devsecops \n* https://snyk.io/series/devsecops/ \n* https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-devsecops.html\n* https://spacelift.io/blog/what-is-devsecops\n\n# Tooling\n\n## Pre-commit time tools\n\nIn this section you can find lifecycle helpers, precommit hook tools and threat modeling tools. Threat modeling tools are specific category by themselves allowing you to simulate and discover potential gaps before you start to develop the software or during the process.\n\nModern DevSecOps tools allow using Threat modeling as code or generation of threat models based on the existing code annotations. \n\n| Name | URL | Description | Meta | \n| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |

of discovering supply chain attacks. SBOM creation and following dependency scanning (Software composition analysis) is critical part of continuous integration (CI). Data series and data trends tracking should be part of CI tooling. You need to know what you produce and what you consume in context of libraries and packages. \n\n| Name | URL | Description | Meta | \n| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :----------: |\n| **CycloneDX** | [https://github.com/orgs/CycloneDX/repositories](https://github.com/orgs/CycloneDX/repositories) | CycloneDX format for **SBOM** |![CycloneDX](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli?style=for-the-badge) | \n| **cdxgen** | [https://github.com/AppThreat/cdxgen](https://github.com/AppThreat/cdxgen) | Generates CycloneDX **SBOM**, supports many languages and package managers. |![CycloneDX](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/AppThreat/cdxgen?style=for-the-badge) | \n| **SPDX** | [https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec) | SPDX format for **SBOM** - Software Package Data Exchange |![SpDX](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/spdx/spdx-spec?style=for-the-badge) | \n| **Snyk** | [https://github.com/snyk/snyk](https://github.com/snyk/snyk) | Snyk scans and monitors your projects for security vulnerabilities |![Snyk](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/snyk/snyk?style=for-the-badge) | \n| **vulncost** | [https://github.com/snyk/vulncost](https://github.com/snyk/vulncost) | Security Scanner for VS Code |![Vulncost](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/snyk/vulncost?style=for-the-badge) |\n| **Dependency Combobulator** | [https://github.com/apiiro/combobulator](https://github.com/apiiro/combobulator) | Dependency-related attacks detection and prevention through heuristics and insight engine (support multiple dependency schemes) | ![Combobulator](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/apiiro/combobulator?style=for-the-badge) |\n| **DependencyTrack** | [https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track) | Dependency security tracking platform |![DependencyTrack](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/DependencyTrack/dependency-track?style=for-the-badge) | \n| **DependencyCheck** | [https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck) | Simple dependency security scanner good for CI |![DependencyCheck](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/jeremylong/DependencyCheck?style=for-the-badge) | \n| **Retire.js** | [https://github.com/retirejs/retire.js/](https://github.com/retirejs/retire.js/) | Helps developers to detect the use of JS-library versions with known vulnerabilities |![Retire.js](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/retirejs/retire.js?style=for-the-badge) |\n| **PHP security checker** | [https://github.com/fabpot/local-php-security-checker](https://github.com/fabpot/local-php-security-checker) | Check vulnerabilities in PHP dependencies |![Retire.js](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/fabpot/local-php-security-checker?style=for-the-badge)| \n| **bundler-audit** | [https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit) | Patch-level verification for bundler |![Bundler audit](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/rubysec/bundler-audit?style=for-the-badge)| \n| **gemnasium** | [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium ) | Dependency Scanning Analyzer based on Gemnasium || \n| **Dependabot** | [https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core) | Automated dependency updates built into GitHub providing security alerts |![Dependabot](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dependabot/dependabot-core?style=for-the-badge)| \n| **Renovatebot** | [https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) | Automated dependency updates, patches multi-platform and multi-language |![Renovatebot](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/renovatebot/renovate?style=for-the-badge)| \n| **npm-check** | [https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check) | Check for outdated, incorrect, and unused dependencies. |![npm-check](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dylang/npm-check?style=for-the-badge)| \n| **Security Scorecards** | [https://securityscorecards.dev](https://securityscorecards.dev) | Checks for several security health metrics on open source libraries and provides a score (0-10) to be considered in the decision making of what libraries to use. |![scorecard](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ossf/scorecard?style=for-the-badge)| \n| **Syft** | [https://github.com/anchore/syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) | CLI tool and library for generating an SBOM from container images (and filesystems). |![syft](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/anchore/syft?style=for-the-badge)| \n\n## Supply chain specific tools \n\nSupply chain is often the target of attacks. Which libraries you use can have a massive impact on security of the final product (artifacts). CI (continuous integration) must be monitored inside the tasks and jobs in pipeline steps. Integrity checks must be stored out of the system and in ideal case several validation runs with comparison of integrity hashes / or attestation must be performed. \n\n| Name | URL | Description | Meta | \n| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :----------: |\n| **Tekton chains** | [https://github.com/tektoncd/chains](https://github.com/tektoncd/chains/) | Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) controller that allows you to manage your supply chain security in Tekton. |![Chains](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/tektoncd/chains?style=for-the-badge) | \n| **in-toto** | [https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/tree/v0.1.0/spec](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/tree/v0.1.0/spec) | An in-toto attestation is authenticated metadata about one or more software artifacts |![in-toto](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/in-toto/attestation?style=for-the-badge) | \n| **SLSA** | [Official GitHub link](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/blob/main/docs/index.md ) | Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts |![SLSA](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/slsa-framework/slsa?style=for-the-badge) | \n| **kritis** | [https://github.com/grafeas/kritis](https://github.com/grafeas/kritis) | Solution for securing your software supply chain for Kubernetes apps |![Kritis](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/grafeas/kritis?style=for-the-badge)|\n| **ratify** | [https://github.com/deislabs/ratify](https://github.com/deislabs/ratify) | Artifact Ratification Framework |![ratify](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/deislabs/ratify?style=for-the-badge)| \n\n\n## SAST\n\nStatic code review tools working with source code and looking for known patterns and relationships of methods, variables, classes and libraries.
