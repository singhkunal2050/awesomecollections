He shared it with friends who were transitioning to management roles and eventually decided to share it as open source. [Here you'll find Joe's still-public document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R1O0OEsQpZcBcLheRlomDrmR2tyEpdRNFnjbLALmbH4/edit#heading=h.loq53mbwc6ut), which provides meatier summaries of the articles you'll find listed here as well as lots of supplementary notes.\n\nIn summer 2017 Lauri Apple found out about Joe's docs via [Software Lead Weekly](http://softwareleadweekly.com/) and asked Joe about posting the contents to GitHub. He gave the greenlight. Lauri changed up the format (very brief blurbs), turned the doc into an [Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), and has continued adding new entries ever since. Helping out with the initial upload were a team of Lauri's former colleagues at [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/). These days the list receives [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) from people around the world.\n\n- \"An awesome collection of resources!\" \u2014[Angie Jones](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908/status/888771075294642178), Twitter\n- \"Thanks again for putting together this tremendous resource!\"\u2014[Dave Golden](https://twitter.com/xdg), MongoDB and contributor\n- \"I have hunted and used this repeatedly in the last few months and referred many others to the material.
