It is not tailored to a specific area (Usability/Performance) or role (Automation/Management). The idea is that you could hand this list to a CS graduate and it would greatly improve their testing skills, efficiency and overall breadth of knowledge. Note that this is for all areas of software testing after the code in question is written (no unit tests/static analysis!).\n\nFinally, I'm sure everyone who reads this list has one thing they want to add. Please read the [How to Contribute](https://github.com/TheJambo/awesome-testing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) page and add to the list. :)\n\n## Contents\n\n- [Software](#software)\n- [Books](#books)\n- [Training](#training-includes-developer-training-for-automation-testers)\n- [Blogs](#blogs)\n- [Newsletters](#newsletters)\n- [Suggested Awesome Lists](#suggested-awesome-lists)\n- [QA & Testing Road Map](#qa-and-testing-road-map)\n- [Others](#others)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)\n- [License](#license)\n\n\n## Software\n\n### Security\n- [BeEF](http://beefproject.com/) - Manipulate the browser exploiting any XSS vulns you find.\n- [OWASP ZAP](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) - This intercepting proxy allows you to see all HTTP traffic and manipulate it in real time.
