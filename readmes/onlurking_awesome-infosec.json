In later videos, we will also look at how to apply the same principles to Windows and other selected operating systems.\n\nOpen Security Books\n===================\n\n#### Crypto 101 - lvh\nComes with everything you need to understand complete systems such as SSL/TLS: block ciphers, stream ciphers, hash functions, message authentication codes, public key encryption, key agreement protocols, and signature algorithms.  Learn how to exploit common cryptographic flaws, armed with nothing but a little time and your favorite programming language. Forge administrator cookies, recover passwords, and even backdoor your own random number generator.\n\n- [Crypto101](https://www.crypto101.io/)\n- [LaTeX Source](https://github.com/crypto101/book)\n\n#### A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography - Dan Boneh & Victor Shoup\nThis book is about constructing practical cruptosystems for which we can argue security under plausible assumptions. The book covers many constructions for different tasks in cryptography. For each task we define the required goal. To analyze the constructions, we develop a unified framework for doing cryptographic proofs. A reader who masters this framework will capable of applying it to new constructions that may not be covered in this book. We describe common mistakes to avoid as well as attacks on real-world systems that illustratre the importance of rigor in cryptography. We end every chapter with a fund application that applies the ideas in the chapter in some unexpected way.\n\n- [A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/cryptobook/)\n\n#### Security Engineering, A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems - Ross Anderson\nThe world has changed radically since the first edition of this book was published in 2001. Spammers, virus writers, phishermen, money launderers, and spies now trade busily with each other in a lively online criminal economy and as they specialize, they get better. In this indispensable, fully updated guide, Ross Anderson reveals how to build systems that stay dependable whether faced with error or malice. Here?s straight talk on critical topics such as technical engineering basics, types of attack, specialized protection mechanisms, security psychology, policy, and more.\n\n- [Security Engineering, Second Edition](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html)\n\n#### Reverse Engineering for Beginners - Dennis Yurichev\nThis book offers a primer on reverse-engineering, delving into disassembly code-level reverse engineering and explaining how to decipher assembly language for those beginners who would like to learn to understand x86 (which accounts for almost all executable software in the world) and ARM code created by C/C++ compilers.\n\n- [Reverse Engineering for Beginners](http://beginners.re/)\n- [LaTeX Source](https://github.com/dennis714/RE-for-beginners)\n\n#### CTF Field Guide - Trail of Bits\nThe focus areas that CTF competitions tend to measure are vulnerability discovery, exploit creation, toolkit creation, and operational tradecraft.. Whether you want to succeed at CTF, or as a computer security professional, you'll need to become an expert in at least one of these disciplines. Ideally in all of them.\n\n- [CTF Field Guide](https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/)\n- [Markdown Source](https://github.com/trailofbits/ctf)\n\nChallenges\n==========\n\n- [Reverse Engineering Challenges](https://challenges.re/)\n\n- [Pwnable.kr](http://pwnable.kr) is a non-commercial wargame site which provides various pwn challenges regarding system exploitation.\n\n- [Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/) (a.k.a. Cryptopals) is a collection of exercises that demonstrate attacks on real-world crypto by letting you implement and break the cryptoschemes yourself.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\n#### OWASP - Open Web Application Security Project\nThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a 501(c)(3) worldwide not-for-profit charitable organization focused on improving the security of software.
