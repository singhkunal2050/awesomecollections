VCS helps us track changes in our documents as well as collaborations on the documents. Needless to say, version control is one of the most useful tools for scientists.\n\n* **git**\n* svn\n* mercurial\n\n\n#### Online Git Service\n\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/): the most popular platform for git with social and collaborations built-in.\n  * GitHub also provides GitHub Actions. With Actions one could automate processes.\n  * GitHub provides GitHub Pages. With GitHub Pages, on could host static files as well as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) built websites.\n* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/): similar to GitHub, GitLab provides git hosting, collaborations, social, automations, and more. GitLab can be both cloud-based and self-hosted using its open-source code.\n  * GitLab includes unlimited free private repositories.\n  * GitLab comes with a continuous integration tool that is more powerful than GitHub Actions.\n* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org): Alternative to GitHub and GitLab with free private repositories.\n\n\n#### Self-hosted Git Server\n\n* [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/): See above at [Online Git Service](#online-git-service).\n* [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/): Painless self-hosted Git service written in Go.\n* [Gogs](https://gogs.io/): A painless self-hosted Git service.\n\n\n#### Enterprise Git Service\n\n* [RhodeCode](https://rhodecode.com/): Centralized control for distributed repositories.

It allows one to focus on one active task instead of on all of them ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)).\n> Tasks can be classified in contexts (@home, @computer, @office, etc), time of action (now, next actions, scheduled or someday) and projects. [Here](https://hamberg.no/gtd/) we have a good pragmatic guide to GTD and [here](https://gettingthingsdone.com/pdfs/tt_workflow_chart.pdf) is a flowchart.\n\n* [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Win`,`Android`,`iOS`,`Win Store`,`Chrome OS`): Almost perfect todo lists with cooperation and sharing.\n* [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/)(`Cloud`,`Android`,`iOS`,`Chrome OS`)\n* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Win`,`Android`,`iOS`,`Win Store`): Not so lightweight but still very good for managing life especially since it has got a lot of integrations from a lot of other services.\n* [Anydo](https://www.any.do/) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Android`,`iOS`): Good because it has a very good daily review which can help users remember what to do.\n* [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Win`,`Android`,`iOS`): Todoist invented the karma system which keeps track of the tasks done.\n* [Taskade](https://taskade.com/) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Win`,`Chrome OS`,`Firefox`,`Android`,`iOS`): Taskade is a collaborative task list and outliner for team projects.\n* [Agenda](https://agenda.com/)(`Mac`): Date-focused note taking.\n\n\n## Cloud Services\n\n*For self-hosted services, check out [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted) on GitHub.*\n\n\n### Math and Programming Online\n\n> There are many tools that allows use of code, perform numerical calculations or analytical derivation online.\n\n* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): free jupyter notebook online.
