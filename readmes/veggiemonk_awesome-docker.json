Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.\n\n_Source:_ [What is Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker/)\n\n# Where to start\n\n-   [Benefits of using Docker](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/docker-benefits) for development and delivery, with a practical roadmap for adoption.\n-   [Bootstrapping Microservices](https://www.manning.com/books/bootstrapping-microservices-with-docker-kubernetes-and-terraform) by [Ashley Davis](https://twitter.com/ashleydavis75) - A practical and project-based guide to building applications with microservices, starts by building a Docker image for a single microservice and publishing it to a private container registry, finishes by deploying a complete microservices application to a production Kubernetes cluster.\n-   [Docker Curriculum](https://github.com/prakhar1989/docker-curriculum): A comprehensive tutorial for getting started with Docker.
