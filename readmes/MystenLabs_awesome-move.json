Move is designed to be a platform-agnostic language to enable common libraries, tooling, and developer communities across diverse blockchains with vastly different data and execution models. Move's ambition is to become the \"JavaScript of web3\" in terms of ubiquity--when developers want to quickly write safe code involving assets, it should be written in Move.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [Overview](#overview)\n- [Move-Powered Blockchains](#move-powered-blockchains)\n- [Books](#books)\n- [Tutorials](#tutorials)\n- [Community](#community)\n- [Code](#code)\n  - [Fungible Tokens](#fungible-tokens)\n  - [Non-Fungible Tokens](#non-fungible-tokens)\n  - [Decentralized Identity](#decentralized-identity)\n  - [DeFi](#defi)\n  - [SocialFi](#socialfi)\n  - [On-Chain Governance](#on-chain-governance)\n  - [Cross-Chain Bridge](#cross-chain-bridge)\n  - [Accounts](#accounts)\n  - [Frameworks](#frameworks)\n  - [Libraries](#libraries)\n  - [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)\n- [Tools](#tools)\n- [IDEs](#ides)\n- [Package Managers](#package-managers)\n- [Wallets](#wallets)\n- [SDKs](#sdks)\n- [Papers](#papers)\n  - [Language Design](#language-design)\n  - [Static Analysis and Verification](#static-analysis-and-verification)\n- [Videos](#videos)\n- [Slides](#slides)\n- [Podcasts](#podcasts)\n- [Blog Posts](#blog-posts)\n- [Security](#security)\n\n## Overview\n\n- [Installation](https://github.com/move-language/move/tree/main/language/tools/move-cli#installation)\n- [Problem Statement](https://github.com/mystenlabs/awesome-move/blob/main/docs/problem_statement.md#problem-statement)\n\n## Move-Powered Blockchains\n\n- [Sui](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui) - A next-generation smart contract platform with high throughput, low latency, and an asset-oriented programming model powered by the Move programming language (in [devnet](https://medium.com/mysten-labs/sui-devnet-public-release-a2be304ff36b)).\n- [0L](https://github.com/OLSF/libra) - A reference implementation of a neutral replicated state machine.
