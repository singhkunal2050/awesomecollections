My name is Filipp, and I have been working with high load distribution systems and services, security, monitoring, continuous deployment and release management (DevOps domain) since 2012.\n\nOne of my passions is developing DevOps solutions and contributing to the open-source community. By sharing my knowledge and experiences, I strive to save time for both myself and others while fostering a culture of collaboration and learning.\n\nI had to leave my home country, Belarus, due to my participation in [protests against the oppressive regime of dictator Lukashenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Belarusian_protests), who maintains a close affiliation with Putin. Since then, I'm trying to build my life from zero in other countries.\n\nIf you are seeking a skilled DevOps lead or architect to enhance your project, I invite you to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipp-frizzy-289a0360/) or explore my valuable contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/Friz-zy/).

This means containers can use the same file system image as the base for the container. When a container writes content to the image, it gets written to a container specific file system. This prevents one container from seeing the changes of another container even if they wrote to the same file system image. Just as important, one container can not change the image content to effect the processes in another container.\n* uid 0 -> user namespaces, uid 0 mappet to random uid outside\n\n3) system services like devices, network, filesystems\n\n* root -> more of services should work on host outside; isolate sensitive functions, run as non-privileged context\n* full privileges -> isolate on kernel level\n\n4) kernel drivers, network stack, security policies\n\n* absolute privileges -> run it in separate vm\n\n5) general like immutable infrastructure\n\n* container is ro\n* write to small separate rw nosuid part\n\n[src](http://www.slideshare.net/jpetazzo/docker-linux-containers-lxc-and-security)  \n[src](https://opensource.com/business/14/9/security-for-docker)\n\n### Technologies for security\n\nThings are better. For example, most modern container technologies can make use of Linux's built-in security tools such as:  \n[AppArmor](http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Main_Page), [SELinux](http://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page) and [Seccomp](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html) policies;  \n[Grsecurity](https://grsecurity.net/);  \n[Control groups (cgroups)](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Resource_Management_Guide/ch01.html);  \n[Kernel namespaces](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html)  \n[src](http://www.itworld.com/article/2920349/security/for-containers-security-is-problem-1.html)\n\nSure, you're deploying seccomp, but you can't use selinux inside your container, because the policy isn't per-namespace (?? lxc uses apparmore for each container...)  \n[sVirt](http://selinuxproject.org/page/SVirt) - selinux for kvm  \n[src](https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/33170.html)\n\nMajor kernel subsystems are not namespaced like:  \n- SELinux  \n- Cgroups  \n- file systems under /sys  \n- /proc/sys, /proc/sysrq-trigger, /proc/irq, /proc/bus\n\nDevices are not namespaced:  \n- /dev/mem  \n- /dev/sd* file system devices  \n- kernel modules\n\nIf you can communicate or attack one of these as a privileged process, you can own the system.  \n[src](https://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-security-selinux)\n\n## Another Information Sources\n\n* [sysdig-container-ecosystem](https://github.com/draios/sysdig-container-ecosystem)  \nThe ecosystem of awesome new technologies emerging around containers and microservices can be a little overwhelming, to say the least. We thought we might be able to help: welcome to the Container Ecosystem Project.\n* [doger.io](http://doger.io/)  \nThis page is an attempt to document the ins and outs of containers on Linux. This is not just restricted to programmers looking to implement containers or use container like features in their own code but also Sysadmins and Users who want to get more of a handle on how containers work 'under the hood'. \n"
