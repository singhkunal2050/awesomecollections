It lets you inject snippets of JavaScript into native apps that run on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android.\n\nFrida is an open source software.\n\nMore info [here](http://www.frida.re/).\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n<!-- MarkdownTOC depth=4 -->\n- [Libraries](#libraries)\n- [Projects](#projects)\n- [Talks & Papers](#talks-and-papers)\n- [Powered by Frida](#frida-powered-by)\n- [Videos](#videos)\n- [Blog posts](#blogs)\n- [Community](#community)\n\n<!-- /MarkdownTOC -->\n\n<a name=\"libraries\" />\n\n## Libraries\n* [frida-android-hooks](https://github.com/antojoseph/frida-android-hooks) -
