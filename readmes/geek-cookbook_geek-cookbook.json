You want to upskill. You want to work with container orchestration, Prometheus and Grafana, Kubernetes\n2. You want to play. You want a safe sandbox to test new tools, keeping the ones you want and tossing the ones you don't.\n3. You want reliability. Once you go from **playing** with a tool to actually **using** it, you want it to be available when you need it. Having to \"*quickly ssh into the basement server and restart plex*\" doesn't cut it when you finally convince your wife to sit down with you to watch sci-fi.\n\n## What have you done for me lately? (CHANGELOG)\n\nCheck out recent change on our [blog](/blog/)\n\n## What do you want from me?\n\nI want your [support][github_sponsor], either in the [financial][github_sponsor] sense, or as a member of our [friendly geek community][discord] (*or both!*)\n\n### Get in touch \ud83d\udc4b\n\n- Come and say hi to me and the friendly geeks in the [Discord][discord] chat or the [Discourse][discourse] forums - say hi, ask a question, or suggest a new recipe!\n- Toot me up, I'm [@funkypenguin][mastodon]! \ud83d\udc26\n- [Contact me][contact] by a variety of channels\n\n### [Sponsor][github_sponsor] / [Patronize][patreon] me \u2764\ufe0f\n\nThe best way to support this work is to become a [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/funkypenguin) / [Patreon patron][patreon] You get :\n\n- warm fuzzies,\n- access to the pre-mix repo,\n- an anonymous plug you can pull at any time,\n- and a bunch more loot based on tier\n\n.. and I get some pocket money every month to buy wine, cheese, and cryptocurrency! \ud83c\udf77 \ud83d\udcb0\n\nImpulsively **[click here (NOW quick do it!)][github_sponsor]** to [sponsor me][github_sponsor] via GitHub, or [patronize me via Patreon][patreon]!\n\n### Work with me \ud83e\udd1d\n\n--8<-- \"work-with-me.md\"\n\n[plex]:             https://www.plex.tv/\n[nextcloud]:        https://nextcloud.com/\n[wordpress]:        https://wordpress.org/\n[ghost]:            https://ghost.io/\n[discord]:          http://chat.funkypenguin.co.nz\n[patreon]:          https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=6982506\n[github_sponsor]:   https://github.com/sponsors/funkypenguin\n[discourse]:        https://forum.funkypenguin.co.nz/\n[contact]:          https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz\n[mastodon]:         https://so.fnky.nz/@funkypenguin\n"
