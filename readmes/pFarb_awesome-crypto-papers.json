I started it because my day job onboarding engineers at [Cossack Labs](https://www.cossacklabs.com) includes educating them in cryptographic matters and giving advise what to read on specific topics, and that involves finding the same materials repeatedly. Hopefully, it will be useful for someone else as well. \n\nIt is aimed at people who are using cryptography in higher-level security systems to implement database encryption, secure sharing, end-to-end encryption in various schemes, and should understand how it works, how it fails and how it is attacked. It is not a list of notable / important / historically important papers (although many of them are here). It is not aimed at academics (who have better grasp of what they need anyway), nor it is aimed for systematic study of wanna-be cryptographers (who better follow structured approach under professional guidance). \n\nIt will be extended gradually as I find something of \"must-have\" value. Pull requests are very welcome.\n\n## Contents\n\n* [Introducing people to data security and cryptography](#introducing-people-to-data-security-and-cryptography).\n  * [Simple: cryptography for non-engineers](#simple-cryptography-for-non-engineers).\n  * [Brief engineer-oriented introductions](#brief-engineer-oriented-introductions).\n* [Specific topics](#specific-topcs).\n  * [Hashing](#hashing) - important bits on modern and classic hashes.\n  * [Secret key cryptography](#secret-key-cryptography) - all things symmetric encryption.\n  * [Cryptanalysis](#cryptanalysis) - attacking cryptosystems.\n  * [Public key cryptography: General and DLP](#public-key-cryptography-general-and-dlp) - RSA, DH and other classic techniques.\n  * [Public key cryptography: Elliptic-curve crypto](#public-key-cryptography-elliptic-curve-crypto) - ECC, with focus on pratcial cryptosystems.\n  * [Zero Knowledge Proofs](#zero-knowledge-proofs) - Proofs of knowledge and other non-revealing cryptosystems.\n  * [Math](#math) - useful math materials in cryptographic context.\n  * [Post-quantum cryptography](#post-quantum-cryptography) - Cryptography in post-quantum period.\n* [Books](#books).\n* [Lectures and educational courses](#lectures-and-educational-courses).\n* [Online crypto challenges](#online-crypto-challenges).\n\n## The list\n\n### Introducing people to data security and cryptography\n\n#### Simple: cryptography for non-engineers\n\n* [Nuts and Bolts of Encryption: A Primer for Policymakers](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten/encryption_primer.pdf).\n* [Keys under Doormats](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/97690/MIT-CSAIL-TR-2015-026.pdf) - Or why cryptography shouldn't be backdoored, by a all-star committee of crypto researches from around the world. \n\n#### Brief introductions\n\n* [An Overview of Cryptography](http://web.archive.org/web/20220918232416/https://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html) - By Gary C.
