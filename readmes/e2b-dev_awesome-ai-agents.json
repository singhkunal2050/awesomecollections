Different from most existing frameworks for multi-agent systems that use pre-defined rules to control the order for agents' action,  **Agents**  includes a  _controller_  function that dynamically decides which agent will perform the next action using an LLM by considering the previous actions, the environment, and the target of the current states. This makes multi-agent communication more flexible.\n-   **Human-Agent interaction**: In addition to letting language agents communicate with each other in an environment, our framework seamlessly supports human users to play the role of the agent by himself/herself and input his/her own actions, and interact with other language agents in the environment.\n-   **Symbolic Control**: Different from existing frameworks for language agents that only use a simple task description to control the entire multi-agent system over the whole task completion process,  **Agents**  allows users to use an  **SOP (Standard Operation Process)**  that defines subgoals/subtasks for the overall task to customize fine-grained workflows for the language agents.\n\n### Links\n- Author: [AIWaves Inc.](https:github.com/aiwaves-cn)\n- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07870.pdf)\n- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents)\n- [Documentation](https://agents-readthedocsio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n- [Tweet](https://twitter.com/wangchunshu/status/1702512370785100133)\n</details>\n\n## [AgentVerse](https://github.com/OpenBMB/AgentVerse)\nA platform designed for deploying multiple LLM-based agents in various applications, focusing on task-solving and simulation frameworks.\n<details>\n\n### Description\n- Assembles multiple agents to collaboratively accomplish tasks.\n- Allows custom environments for observing or interacting with multiple agents.\n\n### Links\n- Paper: [AgentVerse: Facilitating Multi-Agent Collaboration and Exploring Emergent Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10848)\n- [Contact](agentverse2@gmail.com)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Agentverse71134)\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/gDAXfjMw)\n- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AgentVerse/agentVerse)\n\n</details>\n\n## [AI Legion](https://github.com/eumemic/ai-legion)\nA platform for agents to work together, similar in spirit to AutoGPT and Baby AGI, but written in TypeScript\n<details>\n\n\n### Description\n- An LLM-powered autonomous agent platform\n- A framework for autonomous agents who can work together to accomplish tasks\n- Interaction with agents done via console direct messages\n\n### Links\n- Author: [eumemic](https://github.com/eumemic)\n- [Website](https://gpt3demo.com/apps/ai-legion)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/eumemic/ai-legion)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dysmemic)\n</details>\n\n## [Aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider)\n\nA command line tool that lets you pair your program with GPT-3.5/GPT-4, to edit code stored in your local git repository\n\n<details>\n\n### Description\n- Aider is a command line tool that lets you pair program with GPT-3.5/GPT-4, to edit code stored in your local git repository\n- You can start a new project or work with an existing repo.

It is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation. One interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results. (Source: [Weng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). LLM-powered Autonomous Agents\".

Simply specify structure as a (nested) Pydantic object.\n- Batteries-included: vector-databases for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), caching, logging/observability.\n- Specialized agents available: `DocChatAgent`, `SQLChatAgent`, `TableChatAgent` (for tabular data, e.g. csv/dataframes).\n- `DocChatAgent` handles text, PDF, Docx files/URLS, and has state-of-the art techniques \n   for retrieval combining lexical and semantic search.\n- Documentation: https://langroid.github.io/langroid/\n</details>\n\n## [Lemon Agent](https://github.com/felixbrock/lemon-agent)\n\nPlan-Validate-Solve (PVS) Agent for accurate, reliable and reproducable workflow automation\n\n<details>\n\n### Description\n\n- A standalone supervised Plan and Solve Agent specialized on performing read and write operations on various tools like GitHub, HubSpot or Airtable _(ACL 2023 Paper \"[Plan-and-Solve Prompting: Improving Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091)\")_\n- **Separation of tasks and human-in-the-loop interactions**: Lemon Agent is currently holding a Planner Agent and a Solver Agent to keep the agents focussed and increase accuracy. We are planning on adding additional agents real soon. In addition, Lemon Agent will ask for approval at relevant workflow steps to make sure the intended actions are executed.\n- **Unlimited configuration options**: Lemon Agent gives you unlimited configuration options (see example here) when defining your workflow. For instance, you can tell Lemon Agent to ask for permission before executing a workflow step or to drop a \ud83e\uddd4\u200d\u2640\ufe0f dad joke every time the model executes a workflow step.\n- **UI flexibility**: Build any UI on top or engage with Lemon Agent via the built-in CLI.\n- **[Soon] Model & framework agnostic operations**: Lemon Agent is a standalone agent, but can easily be integrated into frameworks like LangChain and be used with any model.\n- **Bonus**: Identify weak spots in your agent\u2019s decision-making capabilities and move to a more deterministic behavior by further configuring your Lemon Agent workflows. **(.html file that can be run without any additional installation)**\n\n### Links\n\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/fWU4rDYSxw)\n- [Author's Twitter](https://twitter.com/felixbrockm)\n\n</details>\n\n## [LLM Agents](https://github.com/mpaepper/llm_agents)\nA minimalistic library for building agents that leverage large language models to automate tasks through a loop of commands and tool integrations.\n\n<details>\n\n### Description\n- Executing Python code in a REPL environment.\n- Conducting searches on Google and Hacker News.\n- Iterating through a cycle of Thought, Action, Observation, and New Thought based on the output of integrated tools.\n- Dynamically appending new information to the prompt for informed decision-making by the agent.\n\n### Links\n\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/mpaepper/llm_agents)\n- [Blog](https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/intelligent-agents-guided-by-llms/)\n\n</details>\n\n## [Local GPT](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/localGPT)\nLocalGPT is an open-source initiative that allows you to converse with your documents without compromising your privacy\n\n\n<details>\n\n### Description\n- Chat with your documents on your local device using GPT models.

cert\n<details>\n\n### Description\n- The agent runs and controls the local Google Chrome, which allows it to interact with the world/services/web apps, just like people interact with the world/services/web apps using Google Chrome\n- The agent itself probably also runs locally and currently, it needs the local Google Chrome to function\n- Our understanding from the demo video is that they use local code and a custom plugin in ChatGPT to control a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome). This setup enables MultiOn to perform tasks like ordering plane tickets as if a human were interacting with the browser directly\n- Use cases\n\t- A lot of cool real use cases, e.g.,\n\t-Sending an email fully autonomously\n\t-Posting a tweet\n\t-Sending a tweet reply to a specific person with a specific message\n\t-Sending a Facebook message to a friend\n\t-Searching for vacation rentals and check pricing for an upcoming trip\n\t-Searching for a wedding venue and starting the wedding planning process\n\t-Scheduling a car wash\n- After introducing the GPT function calling, MultiOn can call itself recursively to spawn more sub-agents\n- Instead of calling multiple functions or APIs you just need one Universal Function that can interact with all services and have it call itself to accomplish more complex tasks in parallel\n\n### Links\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MultiON_AI)\n- Author: [Div Garg](https://twitter.com/DivGarg9)\n</details>\n\n## [Mutable AI](https://mutable.ai/)\nAI Accelerated Software Development\n\n\n<details>\n\n### Description\n- Features\n\t- AI Autocomplete\n\t- Production Quality Code with One Click\n\t- Prompt driven development\n\t- Test Generation (coming soon)\n\n### Links\n- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zAwadbmuVk)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mutableai)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/mutableai/)\n\n</details>\n\n\n## [Naut](https://www.naut.ai/)\nStill in an early stage, with waitlist for early access\n<details>\n\n### Description\n\"Build your team of AI agents that work for you.
