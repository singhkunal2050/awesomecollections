Jing/\u9cb8 means whale, and Ling/\u9cae means\ndace fish in Chinese. The logo of Jingling consist of two intertwined fishes which stands for a\nsmall ecosystem.\\\nWe have a team of very experienced Linux experts who had previously worked at\nLenovo, Alibaba, Samsung, Canonical/Ubuntu, Trolltech and other famous IT\ncompanies.\n\nWe are based in Beijing and California.\n\n## FAQ\n\nIs JingOS free and open-source?\n\n> Yes, JingOS has been open-sourced here on GitHub. And the image files of JingOS can be downloaded from our website.\n\nWhat is JingOS based on?\n\n> JingOS is based on Ubuntu 20.04, KDE Frameworks 5.75, and Plasma Mobile 5.20.\n\n<!--What\u2019s the roadmap of JingOS?\n\n> I posted about Roadmap v1.0 of JingOS 90 in January. I will update the roadmap\n  every quarter.\n\nIf JingOS is a tablet OS, does it require apps to respect the life cycle, like\nwhat happens when suspended? How does it manage permission? Is there a\npermission system like iOS? Are the apps sandboxed? If it can just run Linux\napps, how would they respect life cycle, permission, and stuff? Will you use\nsnap/flatpak for the permissions system?\n\n> Life-cycle management API will come with JingOS v0.8 in March, apps designed\n  for JingOS can be suspended like any other tablet OSs. The permission system\n  and app sandbox are still in discussion, not decided yet.\n\nCompared to other Linux distros, is JingOS optimized for tablet only in the UI /\nspecialized apps, or are there performance tweaks/features as well. Is it\nbasically like a gnome / KDE but with a tablet first focussed, or are there any\n\u201clower-level\u201d differences? What kind of lower-level differences? Drivers?\nPerformance enhancements? What will it help Linux do on tablets especially?\n\n> JingOS v0.6 is mostly optimized only in the UI and specialized apps. But\n  JingOS v0.8 would have lots of lower differences, like performance\n  enhancements.\n\nDo apps have to be created for JingOS to work well? Could I use Spotify or\nDiscord apps on it, or would there need to be JingOS versions first? JingOS just\nrun normal Linux apps, right? So we should be able to build and run Flutter\ndesktop apps on it? Will JingOS support android apps? To fill the gap with\nmissing popular apps.\n\n> Linux apps (.deb, etc.) can run in JingOS well. You can run Android apps in\n  the JingOS ARM version after v1.0 in June.-->\n  \nCan JingOS run Android apps?\n> JingOS ARM for JingPad A1 can run Android apps.
