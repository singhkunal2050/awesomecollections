The ones marked with a \u2b50 are so widespread and\nsolid that they became community standards. You can't be wrong with\nthem. This is the case for Quicklisp, BordeauxThreads and\nsuch. Libraries denoted with a \ud83d\udc4d are the ones we like and want to\npromote here at the Awesome-cl list. They proved solid, they may solve\na problem better than a community standard but they aren't as\nwidespread, or not considered as stable. For example, we prefer\nSpinneret over Cl-Who.\n\nAdd something new!

Please submit a pull request or create\nan issue to add a new framework, library or software to the list.\n\nThe rules we (try to) respect are the followings:\n\n- by default, add a library to the end of its section.\n- absolute de-facto libraries, like BordeauxThreads or Quicklisp,\n  should be denoted with a \u2b50 (Unicode code U+2B50).\n- two libraries very similar in scope should be side by side, or in a\n  section of their own.\n- do some curation based on your experience and the state of the\n  library's documentation. We do *not* aim at listing every existing\n  CL library (see Cliki for that) nor to list every\n  \"popular\" library (see Quicklisp stats).\n- as such, the libraries we like best are marked with a \ud83d\udc4d (`1F44D`\n  unicode character).
